through the Ādityas most auspicious shelter through their most recent succour may we conquer.
may they the mighty giving ear establish this sacrifice to make us free and sinless.
let aditi rejoice and the Ādityas varuṇa mitra aryaman most righteous.
may they the guardians of the world protect us and to show favour drink this day our soma.
all universal deities the maruts all the Ādityas yea and all the Ṛbhus.
indra and agni and the aśvins lauded preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
