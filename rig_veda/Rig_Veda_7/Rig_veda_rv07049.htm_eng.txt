forth from the middle of the flood the waterstheir chief the seaflow cleansing never sleeping.
indra the bull the thunderer dug their channels here let those waters goddesses protect me.
waters which come from heaven or those that wander dug from the earth or flowing free by nature.
bright purifying speeding to the ocean here let those waters goddesses protect me.
those amid whom goes varuṇa the sovran he who discriminates mens truth and falsehood.
distilling meath the bright the purifying here let those waters goddesses protect me.
they from whom varuṇa the king and soma and all the deities drink strength and vigour.
they into whom vaiśvānara agni entered here let those waters goddesses protect me.
