let me not yet king varuṇa enter into the house of clay.
have mercy spare me mighty lord.
when thunderer i move along tremulous like a windblown skin.
have mercy spare me mighty lord.
o bright and powerful god through want of strength i erred and went astray.
have mercy spare me mighty lord.
thirst found thy worshipper though he stood in the midst of waterfijods.
have mercy spare me mighty lord.
o varuṇa whatever the offence may be which we as men commit against the heavenly host.
when through our want of thought we violate thy laws punish us not o god for that iniquity.
