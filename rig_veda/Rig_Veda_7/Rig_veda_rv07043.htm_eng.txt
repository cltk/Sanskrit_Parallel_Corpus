sing out the pious at your sacrifices to move with adorations earth and heaven.
the holy singers whose unmatched devotions like a trees branches part in all directions.
let sacrifice proceed like some fleet courser with one accord lift ye on high the ladles.
strew sacred grass meet for the solenm service bright flames that love the gods have mounted upward.
like babes in arms reposing on their mother let the gods sit upon the grasss summit.
let general fire make bright the flame of worship scorn us not agni in the godsÂ’ assembly.
gladly the gods have let themselves be honoured milking the copious streams of holy order.
the highest might today is yours the vasits come ye as many as ye are oneminded.
so agni send us wealth among the people may we be closely knit to thee o victor.
unharmed and rich and taking joy together preserve us evermore ye ods with blessings.
