come to our prayers o indra thou who knowest let thy bay steeds be yoked and guided hither.
though mortal men on every side invoke thee still give thine ear to us o allimpeller.
thy greatness reacheth to our invocation the sages prayer which potent god thou guardest.
what time thy hand o mighty holds the thunder awful in strength thou hast become resistless.
what time thou drewest both worldhalves together like heroes led by thee who call each other.
for thou wast born for strength and high dominionthen een the active overthrew the sluggish.
honour us in these present days o indra for hostile men are making expiation.
our sin that sinless varuṇa discovered the wondrouswise hath long ago forgiven.
we will address this liberal lord this indra that he may grant us gifts of ample riches.
best favourer of the singers prayer and praises preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
