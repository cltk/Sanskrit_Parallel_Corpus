agni erect hath shown enriching favour the flame goes forward to the gods assembly.
like carborne men the stones their path have chosen let the priest quickened celebrate our worship.
soft to the tread their sacred grass is scattered these go like kings amid the band around them.
at the folks early call on night and morningvāyu and pūṣan with his team to bless us.
here on their path the noble gods proceeded in the wide firmament the beauteous decked them.
bend your way hither ye who travel widely hear this our envoy who hath gone to meet you.
for they are holy aids at sacrifices all gods approach the place of congregation.
bring these desirous to our worship agni swift the nisatyas bhaga and purandhi.
agni to these mens hymns from earth from heaven bring mitra varuṇa indra and agni.
and aryaman and aditi and viṣṇu sarasvatī be joyful and the maruts.
even as the holy wish the gift is offered may he unsated come when men desire him.
give neverfailing everconquering riches with gods for our allies may we be victors.
now have both worlds been praised by the vasisthas and holy mitra varuṇa and agni.
may they bright deities make our song supremest preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
