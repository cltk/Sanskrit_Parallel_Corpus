with reverence and with offered gifts serve we the god whose flame is bright.
let us bring jātavedas fuel and adore agni when we invoke the gods.
agni may we perform thy rites with fuel and honour thee o holy one with praises.
honour thee priest of sacrifice with butter thee god of blessed light with our oblation.
come agni with the gods to our invoking come pleased to offerings sanctified with vaṣaṭ.
may we be his who pays thee god due honour ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
