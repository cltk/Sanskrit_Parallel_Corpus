rousing the lands where mens five tribes are settled dawn hath disclosed the pathways of the people.
she hath sent out her sheen with beauteous oxen the sun with light hath opened earth and heaven.
they paint their bright rays on the skys far limits the dawns come on like tribes arrayed for battle.
thy cattle closely shutting up the darkness as savitar spreads his arms give forth their lustre.
wealthy most like to indra dawn hath risen and brought forth lauds that shall promote our welfare.
daughter of heaven a goddess she distributes best of aá¹…girases treasures to the pious.
bestow on us o dawn that ample bounty which thou didst send to those who sang thy praises.
thou whom with bellowings of a bull they quickened thou didst unbar the firmset mountains portals.
impelling every god to grant his bounty sending to us the charm of pleasant voices.
vouchsafe us thoughts for profit as thou breakest preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
