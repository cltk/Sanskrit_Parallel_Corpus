born in the heavens the dawn hath flushed and showing her majesty is come as law ordaineth.
she hath uncovered fiends and hateful darkness best of aṅgirases hath waked the pathways.
rouse us this day to high and happy fortune to great felicity o dawn promote us.
vouchsafe us manifold and splendid riches famed among mortals manbefriending goddess.
see lovely mornings everlasting splendours bright with their varied colours have approached us.
filling the region of midair producing the rites of holy worship they have mounted.
she yokes her chariot far away and swiftly visits the lands where the five tribes are settled.
looking upon the works and ways of mortals daughter of heaven the worlds imperial lady.
she who is rich in spoil the spouse of sūrya wondrously opulent rules all wealth and treasures.
consumer of our youth the seers extol her lauded by priests rich dawn shines out refulgent.
apparent are the steeds of varied colour the red steeds carrying resplendent morning.
on her alllovely car she comes the fair one and brings rich treasure for her faithful servant.
true with the true and mighty with the mighty with gods a goddess holy with the holy.
she brake strong fences down and gave the cattle the kine were lowing as they greeted morning.
o dawn now give us wealth in kine and heroes and horses fraught with manifold enjoyment.
protect our sacred grass from mans reproaches preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
