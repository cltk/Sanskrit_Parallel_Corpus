ye liberal heroes vājas and Ṛbhukṣans come and delight you with our flowing soma.
may your strength vibhus as ye come to meet us turn hitherward your car that brings men profit.
may we as Ṛbhu with your Ṛbhus conquer strength with our strength as vibhus with the vibhus.
may vāja aid us in the fight for booty and helped by indra may we quell the foeman.
for they rule many tribes with high dominion and conquer all their foes in close encounter.
may indra vibhvan vāja and Ṛbhukṣan destroy by turns the wicked foemans valour.
now deities give us ample room and freedom be all of you oneminded our protection.
so let the vasus grant us strength and vigour preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
