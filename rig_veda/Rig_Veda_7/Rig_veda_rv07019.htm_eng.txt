he like a bull with sharpened horns terrific singly excites and agitates all the people.
thou givest him who largely pours libations his goods who pours not for his own possession.
thou verily indra gavest help to kutsa willingly giving car to him in battle.
when aiding Ārjuneya thou subduedst to him both kuyava and the dāsa Śuṣṇa.
o bold one thou with all thine aids hast boldly holpen sudās whose offerings were accepted.
pūru in winning land and slaying foemen and trasadasyu son of purukutsa.
at the gods banquet herosouled with heroes lord of bay steeds thou slewest many foemen.
thou sentest in swift death to sleep the dasyu both cumuri and dhuni for dabhīti.
these were thy mighty powers that thunderwielder thou swiftly crushedst nineandninety castles.
thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught thou slewest namuci thou slewest vṛtra.
old are the blessings indra which thou gavest sudās the worshipper who brought oblations.
for thee the strong i yoke thy strong bay horses may our prayers reach thee and win strength most mighty.
give us not up lord of bay horses victor in this thine own assembly to the wicked.
deliver us with true and faithful succours dear may we be to thee among the princes.
may we men maghavan the friends thou lovest near thee be joyful under thy protection.
fain to fulfil the wish of atithigva humble the pride of turvaśa and yadva.
swiftly in truth o maghavan about thee men skilled in hymning sing their songs and praises.
elect us also into their assembly who by their calls on thee despoiled the niggards.
thine are these lauds o manliest of heroes lauds which revert to us and give us riches.
favour these indra when they fight with faemen as friend and hero and the heroes helper.
now lauded for thine aid heroic indra sped by our prayer wax mighty in thy body.
apportion to us strength and habitations ye gods protect us evermore with blessings.
