present to varuṇa thine hymn vasiṣṭha bright most delightful to the bounteous giver.
who bringeth on to us the bull the lofty the holy laden with a thousand treasures.
and now as i am come before his presence i take the face of varuṇa for agnis.
so might he bringlord also of the darknessthe light in heaven that i may see its beauty.
when varuṇa and i embark together and urge our boat into the midst of ocean.
we when we ride oer ridges of the waters will swing within that swing and there be happy.
varuṇa placed vasiṣṭha in the vessel and deftly with his niight made him a Ṛṣi.
when days shone bright the sage made him a singer while the heavens broadened and the dawns were lengthened.
what hath become of those our ancient friendships when without enmity we walked together.
i varuṇa thou glorious lord have entered thy lofty home thine house with thousand portals.
if he thy true ally hath sinned against thee still varuṇa he is the friend thou lovedst.
let us not living one as sinners i know thee give shelter as a sage to him who lauds thee.
while we abide in these fixed habitations and from the lap of aditi win favour.
may varuṇa untie the bond that binds us preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
