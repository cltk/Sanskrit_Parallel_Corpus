roused from their bosom is the dawns beloved the joyous priest most sapient purifier.
he gives a signal both to gods and mortals to gods oblations riches to the pious.
most wise is he who forcing doors of paṇis brought the bright sun to us who feedeth many.
the cheerful priest mens friend and homecompanion through still nights darkness he is made apparent.
wise neer deceived uncircumscribed refulgent our gracious guest a friend with good attendants.
shines forth with wondrous light before the mornings the young plants hath he entered child of waters.
seeking our gatherings he your jātavedas hath shone adorable through human ages.
who gleams refulgent with his lovely lustre the kine have waked to meet him when enkindled.
go on thy message to the gods and fail not o agni with their band who pray and worship.
bring all the gods that they may give us riches sarasvatī the maruts aśvins waters.
vasiṣṭha when enkindling thee o agni hath slain jarutha give us wealth in plenty.
sing praise in choral song o jātavedas ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
