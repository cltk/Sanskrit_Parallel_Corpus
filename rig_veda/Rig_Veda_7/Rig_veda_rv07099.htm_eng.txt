men come not nigh thy majesty who growest beyond all bound and measure with thy body.
both thy two regions of the earth o viṣṇu we know thou god knowest the highest also.
none who is born or being born god viṣṇu hath reached the utmost limit of thy grandeur.
the vast high vault of heaven hast thou supported and fixed earths eastern pinnacle securely.
rich in sweet food be ye and rich in milchkine with fertile pastures fain to do men service.
both these worlds viṣṇu hast thou stayed asunder and firmly fixed the earth with pegs around it.
ye have made spacious room for sacrificing by generating sūrya dawn and agni.
o heroes ye have conquered in your battles even the bulljawed dāsas wiles and magic.
ye have destroyed thou indra and thou viṣṇu Śambaras nineandninety fenced castles.
ye twain smote down a hundred times a thousand resistless heroes of the royal varcin.
this is the lofty hymn of praise exalting the lords of mighty stride the strong and lofty.
i laud you in the solemn synods viṣṇu pour ye food on us in our camps o indra.
o viṣṇu unto thee my lips cry vaṣaṭ let this mine offering sipivista please thee.
may these my songs of eulogy exalt thee preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
