associate with fires make your god agni envoy at sacrifice best skilled in worship.
established firm among mankind the holy flamecrowned and fed with oil the purifier.
like a steed neighing eager for the pasture when he hath stepped forth from the great enclosure.
then the wind following blows upon his splendour and straight the path is black which thou hast travelled.
from thee a bull but newly born o agni the kindled everlasting flames rise upward.
aloft to heaven thy ruddy smoke ascendeth agni thou speedest to the gods as envoy.
thou whose fresh lustre oer the earth advanceth when greedily with thy jaws thy food thou eatest.
like a host hurried onward comes thy lasso fierce with thy tongue thou piercest as twere barley.
the men have decked him both at eve and morning most youthful agni as they tend a courser.
they kindle him a guest within his dwelling bright shines the splendour of the worshipped hero.
o fair of face beautiful is thine aspect when very near at hand like gold thou gleamest.
like heavens thundering roar thy might approaches and like the wondrous sun thy light thou showest.
that we may worship with your hail to agni with sacrificial cakes and fat oblations.
guard us o agni with those boundless glories as with a hundred fortresses of iron.
thine are resistless songs for him who offers and herogiving hymns wherewith thou savest.
with these o son of strength o jātavedas guard us preserve these princes and the singers.
when forth he cometh like an axe newsharpened pure in his form resplendent in his body.
sprung sought with eager longing from his parents for the gods worship sage and purifier.
shine this felicity on us o agni may we attain to perfect understanding.
all happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
