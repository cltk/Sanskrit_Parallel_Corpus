we have beheld her earliest lights approaching her many glories part on high asunder.
on car sublime refulgent wending hither o uṣas bring the wealth that makes us happy.
the fire wellkindied sings aloud to greet her and with their hymns the priests are chaming welcome.
uṣas approaches in her splendour driving all evil darkness far away the goddess.
apparent eastward are those lights of morning sending out lustre as they rise around them.
she hath brought forth sun sacrifice and agni and far away hath fled detested darkness.
rich daughter of the sky we all behold her yea all men look on dawn as she is breaking.
fler car that moves selfharnessed hath she mounted the car drawn onward by her wellyoked horses.
inspired with loving thoughts this day to greet thee we and our wealthy nobles have awakened.
show yourselves fruitful dawns as ye are rising preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
