o vĀyu drinker of the pure be near us a thousand teams are thine allbounteous giver.
to thee the rapturebringing juice is offered whose first draught god thou takest as thy portion.
prompt at the holy rites forth came the presser with somadraughts for indra and for vāyu.
when ministering priests with strong devotion bring to you twain the first taste of the soma.
the teams wherewith thou seekest him who offers within his home o viyu to direct him.
therewith send wealth to us with full enjoyment a hero son and gifts of kine and horses.
near to the gods and making indra joyful devout and offering precious gifts to vāyu.
allied with princes smiting down the hostile may we with heroes conquer foes in battle.
with thy yoked teams in hundreds and in thousands come to our sacrifice and solemn worship.
come vāyu make thee glad at this libation preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
