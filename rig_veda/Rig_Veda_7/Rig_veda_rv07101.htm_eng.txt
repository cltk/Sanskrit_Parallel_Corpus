speak forth three words the words which light precedeth which milk this udder that produceth nectar.
quickly made manifest the bull hath bellowed engendering the germ of plants the infant.
giver of growth to plants the god who ruleth over the waters and all moving creatures.
vouchsafe us triple shelter for our refuge and threefold light to succour and befriend us.
now he is sterile now begetteth offspring even as he willeth doth he change his figure.
the fathers genial flow bedews the mother therewith the sire therewith the son is nourished.
in him all living creatures have their being and the three heavens with triplyflowing waters.
three reservoirs that sprinkle down their treasure shed their sweet streams around him with a murmur.
may this my song to sovran lord parjanya come near unto his heart and give him pleasure.
may we obtain the showers that bring enjoyment and godprotected plants with goodly fruitage.
he is the bull of all and their impregner he holds the life of all things fixed and moving.
may this rite save me till my hundredth autumn preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
