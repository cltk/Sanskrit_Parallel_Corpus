this stream sarasvatī with fostering current comes forth our sure defence our fort of iron.
as on a car the flood flows on surpassing in majesty and might all other waters.
pure in her course from mountains to the ocean alone of streams sarasvatī hath listened.
thinking of wealth and the great world of creatures she poured for nahuṣa her milk and fatness.
friendly to man he grew among the women a strong young steer amid the holy ladies.
he gives the fleet steed to our wealthy princes and decks their bodies for success in battle.
may this sarasvatī be pleased and listen at this our sacrifice auspicious lady.
when we with reverence on our knees implore her closeknit to wealth most kind to those she loveth.
these offerings have ye made with adoration say this sarasvatī and accept our praises.
and placing us under thy dear protection may we approach thee as a tree for shelter.
for thee o blest sarasvatī vasiṣṭha hath here unbarred the doors d sacred order.
wax bright one and give strength to him who lauds thee preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
