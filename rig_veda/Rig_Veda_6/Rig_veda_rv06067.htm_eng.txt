now mitravaruṇa shall be exalted high by your songs noblest of all existing.
they who as twere with reins are best controllers unequalled with their arms to check the people.
to you two gods is this my thought extended turned to the sacred grass with loving homage.
give us o mitravaruṇa a dwelling safe from attack which ye shall guard boongivers.
come hither mitravaruṇa invited with eulogies and loving adoration.
ye who with your might as workcontrollers urge even men who quickly hear to labour.
whom of pure origin like two strong horses aditi bore as babes in proper season.
whom mighty at your birth the mighty goddess brought forth as terrors to the mortal foeman.
as all the gods in their great joy and gladness gave you with one accord your high dominion.
as ye surround both worlds though wide and spacious your spies are ever true and never bewildered.
so through the days maintaining princely power ye prop the height as twere from loftiest heaven.
the star of all the gods established filleth the heaven and earth with food of man who liveth.
take the strong drink to quaff till ye are sated when he and his attendants fill the chamber.
the young maids brook not that none seeks to win them when quickeners of all they scatter moisture.
so with your tongue come ever when your envoy faithful and very wise attends our worship.
nourished by holy oil he this ygur glory annihilate the sacrificers trouble.
when mitravaruṇa they strive against you and break tlie friendly laws ye have established.
they neither gods nor men in estimation like apis sons have godless sacrifices.
when singers in their song uplift their voices some chant the nivid texts with steady purpose.
then may we sing you lauds that shall be fruitful dp ye not rival all the gods in greatness.
o mitravaruṇa may your large bounty come to us hither near to this our dwelling.
when the kine haste to us and when they harness the fleetfoot mettled stallion for the battle.
