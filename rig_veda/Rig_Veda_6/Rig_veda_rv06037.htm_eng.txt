let thy bay horses yoked o mighty indra bring thy car hither fraught with every blessing.
for thee the heavenly een the poor invoketh may we this day thy feastcompanions prosper.
forth to the vat the brown drops flow for service and purified proceed directly forward.
may indra drink of this our guest aforetime celestial king of the strong draught of soma.
bringing us hitherward allpotent indra on wellwheeled chariot may the steeds who bear him.
convey him on the road direct to glory and neer may vāyus amṛta cease and fail him.
supreme he stirs this man to give the guerdonindra most efficacious of the princes.
wherewith o thunderer thou removest sorrow and bold one partest wealth among the nobles.
indra is hewho gives enduring vigour may our songs magnify the god most mighty.
best vṛtraslayer be the hero indra these things he gives as prince with strong endeavour.
