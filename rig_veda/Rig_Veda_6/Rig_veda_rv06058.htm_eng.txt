like heaven art thou one form is bright one holy like day and night dissimilar in colour.
all magic powers thou aidest selfdepen dent auspicious be thy bounty here o pūṣan.
goatborne the guard of cattle he whose home is strength inspirer of the hymn set over all the world.
brandishing here and there his lightly moving goad beholding every creature pūṣan god goes forth.
o pūṣan with thy golden ships that travel across the ocean in the airs midregion.
thou goest on an embassy to sūrya subdued by love desirous of the glory.
near kinsman of the heaven and earth is pūṣan liberal lord of food of wondrous iustre.
whom strong and vigorous and swiftlymoving subdued by love the deities gave to sūrya.
