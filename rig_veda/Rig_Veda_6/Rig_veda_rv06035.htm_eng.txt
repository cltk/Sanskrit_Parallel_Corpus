when shall our prayers rest in thy car beside thee when dost thou give the singer food for thousands.
when wilt thou clothe this poets laud with plenty and when wilt thou enrich our hymns with booty.
when wilt thou gatber men with men o indra heroes with heroes and prevail in combat.
thou shalt win triply kine in frays for cattle so indra give thou us celestial glory.
yea when wilt thou o indra thou most mighty make the prayer allsustaining for the singer.
when wilt thou yoke as we yoke songs thy horses and come to offerings that bring wealth in cattle.
grant to the singer food with store of cattle splendid with horses and the fame of riches.
send food to swell the milchcow good at milking bright be its shine among the bharadvājas.
lead otherwise this present foeman Śakra hence art thou praised as hero foe destroyer.
him who gives pure gifts may i praise unceasing sage quicken the aṅgirases by devotion.
