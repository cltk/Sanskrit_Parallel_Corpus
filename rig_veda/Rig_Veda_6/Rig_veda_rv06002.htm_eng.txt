thou agni even as mitra hast a princely glory of thine own.
thou active vasu makest fame increase like full prosperity.
for verily men pray to thee with sacrifices and with songs.
to thee the friendly courser seen of all comes speeding through the air.
of one accord men kindle thee heavens signal of the sacrifice.
when craving bliss this race of man invites thee to the solemn rite.
let the man thrive who travails sore in prayer far thee the bountiful.
he with the help of lofty dyaus comes safe through straits of enmity.
the mortal who with fuel lights thy flame and offers unto thee.
supports a house with many a branch agni to live a hundred years.
thy bright smoke lifts itself aloft and farextended shines in heaven.
for purifier like the sun thou beamest with thy radiant glow.
for in mens houses thou must be glorified as a wellloved guest.
gay like an elder in a fort claiming protection like a son.
thou agni like an able steed art urged by wisdom in the wood.
thou art like wind food home art thou like a young horse that runs astray.
een things imperishable thou o agni like a gazing ox.
eatest when hosts eternal one of thee the mighty rend the woods.
agni thou enterest as priest the home of men who sacrifice.
lord of the people prosper them accept the ofrering aṅgiras.
o agni god with mitras might call hither the favour of the gods from earth and heaven.
bring weal from heaven that men may dwell securely may we oercome the foes malign oppressions may we oercome them through thy help oercome them.
