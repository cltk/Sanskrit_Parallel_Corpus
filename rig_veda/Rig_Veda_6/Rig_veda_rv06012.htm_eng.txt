king of trimmed grass herald within the dwelling may agni worship the impellers worldhalves.
he son of strength the holy from a distance hath spread himself abroad with light like sūrya.
in thee most wise shall dyaus for full perfection king holy one pronounce the call to worship.
found in three places like the speeders footstep come to present mens riches as oblations.
whose blaze most splendid sovran in the forest shines waxing on his way like the  impeller.
he knows himself like as a guileless smelter not to be stayed among the plants immortal.
our friends extol him like a steed for vigour even agni in the dwelling jataveas.
trcefed he fights with power as doth a champion like dawns sire to be praised with sacrifices.
men wonder at his shining glows when paring the woods with case oer the broad earth he goeth.
and like a rushing flood loosed quickly burneth swift as a guilty thief oer desert places.
so mighty thou protectest us from slander o champion agni with all fires enkindled.
bring opulence and drive away affliction may brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.
