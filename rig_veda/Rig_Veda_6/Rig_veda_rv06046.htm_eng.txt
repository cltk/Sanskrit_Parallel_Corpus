and now o indra strengthen us come near and aid us in the fight.
what time the feathered shafts are flying in the air the arrows with their sharpened points.

when indra in the mighty fray thou urgest chargers to their speed.
on the uneven road and on a toilsome path like falcons eager for renown.
speeding like rivers rushing down a steep descent responsive to the urging call.
that come like birds attracted to the bait held in by reins in both the drivers hands.
