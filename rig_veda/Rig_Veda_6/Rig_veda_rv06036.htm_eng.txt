thy raptures ever were for all mens profit so evermore have been thine earthly riches.
thou still hast been the dealerforth of vigour since among gods thou hast had power and godhead.
men have obtained his strength by sacrificing and ever urged him on to hero valour.
for the reinseizing the impetuous charger they furnished power even for vá¹›tras slaughter.
associate with him as teams of horses help manly might and vigour follow indra.
as rivers reach the sea so strong with praises our holy songs reach him the comprehensive.
lauded by us let flow the spring o indra of excellent and brightlyshining riches.
for thou art lord of men without an equal of all the world thou art the only sovran.
hear what thou mayst hear thou who fain for worship as heaven girds earth guardest thy servants treasure.
tlat thou mayst be our own joying in power famed through thy might in every generation.
