son of deliverance come bright god.
let us twain go together be our charioteer of sacrifice.
we pray for wealth to thee most skilled of charioteers with braided hair.
lord of great riches and our friend.
bright god whose steeds are goats thou art a stream of wealth a treasureheap.
the friend of every pious man.
pūṣan who driveth goats for steeds the strong and mighty who is called.
his sisters lover will we laud.
his mothers suitor i address may he who loves his sister hear.
brother of indra and my friend.
may the surefooted goats come nigh conveying pūṣan on his car.
the god who visiteth mankind.
