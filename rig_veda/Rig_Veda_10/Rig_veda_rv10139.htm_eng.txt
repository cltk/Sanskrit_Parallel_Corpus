savitar goldenhaired hath lifted eastward bright with the sunbeams his eternal lustre.
he in whose energy wise pūṣan marches surveying all existence like a herdsman.
beholding men he sits amid the heaven filling the two worldhalves and airs wide region.
he looks upon the rich farspreading pastures between the eastern and the western limit.
he root of wealth the gathererup of treasures looks with his might on every form and figure.
savitar like a godẉhose law is constant stands in the battle for the spoil like indra.
waters from sacrifice came to the gandharva visvavasu o soma when they saw him.
indra approaching quickly marked their going and looked around upon the suns enclosures.
this song visvavasu shall sing us meter of airs midrealm celestial gandharva.
that we may know aright both truth and falsehood may he inspire our thoughts and help our praises.
in the floods track he found the bootyseeker the rocky cowpens doors he threw wide open.
these the gandharva told him rowed with amṛta indra knew well the puissancc of the dragons.
