ye made that atri worn with eld free as a horse to win the goal.
when ye restored to youth and strength kakṣīvān like a car renewed.
ye freed that atri like a horse and brought him newlyborn to earth.
ye loosed him like a firmtied knot which gods unsoiled by dust had bound.
heroes who showed most wondrous power to atri strive to win fair songs.
for then o heroes of the sky your hymn of praise shall cease no more.
this claims your notice bounteous gods  oblation aśvins and our love.
that ye o heroes in the fight may bring us safe to ample room.
ye twain to bhujyu tossed about in ocean at the regions end.
nāsatyas with your winged sterds came nigh and gave him strength to win.
come with your joys most liberal gods lords of all treasures bringing weal.
like fresh full waters to a well so heroes come and be with us.
