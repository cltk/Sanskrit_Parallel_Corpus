uniting with a body be thou welcome dear to the gods in their sublimest birthplace.
bearing thy body vajin may thy body afford us blessing and thyself protection.
unswerving stablish as it were in heaven thine own light as the mighty gods supporter.
strong steed art thou go to the yearning maidens with vigour happily go to heaven and praises.

part of their grandeur have the fathers also gained the gods have seated mental power in them as gods.
they have embraced within themselves all energies which issuing forth again into their bodies pass.
they strode through all the region with victorious might establishing the old immeasurable laws.
they compassed in their bodies all existing things and streamed forth offipring in many successive forms.
in two ways have the sons established in his place the asura who finds the light by the third act.
