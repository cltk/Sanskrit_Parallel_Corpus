turn hither agni speak to us come to us with a gracious mind.
enrich us master of the house thou art the giver of our wealth.
let aryarnan vouchsafe us wealth and bhaga and bṛhaspati.
let the gods give their gifts and let sūnṛtā goddess grant us wealth.
we call king soma to our aid and agni with our songs and hymns.
Ādityas viṣṇu sūrya and the brahman priest bṛhaspati.
indra vāyu bṛhaspati gods swift to listen we invoke.
that in the synod all the folk may be benevolent to us.
urge aryaman to send us gifts and indra and bṛhaspati.
vāta viṣṇu sarasvatī and the strong courser savitar.
do thou o agni with thy fires strengthen our prayer and sacrifice.
urge givers to bestow their wealth to aid our service of the gods.
