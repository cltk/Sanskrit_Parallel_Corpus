that general car of yours invoked by many a man that comes to our libations threewheeled meet for lauds.
that circumambient car worthy of sacrifice we call with our pure hymns at earliest flush of dawn.
ye o nāsatyas mount that earlyharnessed car that travels early laden with its freight of balm.
wherewith ye heroes visit clans who sacrifice even the poor mans worship where the priest attends.
if to the deft adhvaryu with the meath in hand or to the kindler firm in strength the household friend.
or to the sages poured libations ye approach come thence o aśvins now to drink the offered meath.
