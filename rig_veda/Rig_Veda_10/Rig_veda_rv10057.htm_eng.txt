let us not indra leave the path the somapressers sacrifice.
let no malignity dwell with us.
may we obtain completely wrought the thread spun out to reach the gods.
that perfecteth the sacrifice.
we call the spirit hither with the soma of our parted sires.
yea with the fathers holy hymns.
thy spirit come to thee again for wisdom energy and lire.
that thou mayst long behold the sun.
o fathers may the heavenly folk give us our spirit once again.
that we may be with those who live.
o soma with the spirit still within us blest with progeny.
may we be busied in the law.
