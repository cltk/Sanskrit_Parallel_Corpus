from out the earth i dig this plant a herb of most effectual power.
wherewith one quells the rival wife and gains the husband for oneself.
auspicious with expanded leaves sent by the gods victorious plant.
blow thou the rival wife away and make my husband only mine.
stronger am  o stronger one yea mightier than the mightier.
and she who is my rival wife is lower than the lowest dames.
her very name i utter not she takes no pleasure in this man.
far into distance most remote drive we the rival wife away.
i am the conqueror and thou thou also act victorious.
as victory attends us both we will subdue my fellowwife.
i have gained thee for vanquisher have grasped thee with a stronger spell.
as a cow hastens to her calf so let thy spirit speed te me hasten like water on its way.
