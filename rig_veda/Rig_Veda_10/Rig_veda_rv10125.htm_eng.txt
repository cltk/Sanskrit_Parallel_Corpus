i travel with the rudras and the vasus with the Ādityas and allgods i wander.
i hold aloft both varuṇa and mitra indra and agni and the pair of aśvins.
i cherish and sustain highswelling soma and tvaṣṭar i support pūṣan and bhaga.
i load with wealth the zealous sdcrificer who pours the juice and offers his oblation.
i am the queen the gathererup of treasures most thoughtful first of those who merit worship.
thus gods have stablished me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in.
through me alone all eat the food that feeds themeach man who sees brewhes hears the word outspoken.
they know it not but yet they dwell beside me hear one and all the truth as i declare it.
verily myself announce and utter the word that gods and men alike shall welcome.
i make the man i love exceeding mighty make him a sage a Ṛṣi and a brahman.
i bend the bow for rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater of devotion.
i rouse and order battle for the people and i have penetrated earth and heaven.
on the worlds summit i bring forth the father my home is in the waters in the ocean.
thence i extend oer all existing creatures and touch even yonder heaven with my forehead.
i breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest the while i hold together all existence.
beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens i have become so mighty in my grandeur.
