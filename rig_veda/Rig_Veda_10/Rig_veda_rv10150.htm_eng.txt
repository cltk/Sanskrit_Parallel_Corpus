thou bearer of oblations though kindled art kindled for the gods.
with the Ādityas rudras vasus come to us to show us favour come to us.
come hither and accept with joy this sacrifice and hymn of ours.
o kindled god we mortals are invoking thee calling on thee to show us grace.
i laud thee jātavedas thee lord of all blessings with my song.
agni bring hitherward the gods whose laws we love whose laws we love to show us grace.
agni the god was made the great highpriest of gods Ṛṣis have kindled agni men of mortal mould.
agni i invocate for winning ample wealth kindly disposed for winning wealth.
atri and bharadvāja and gavisthira kaṇva and trasadasyu in our fight he helped.
on agni calls vasiṣṭha even the household priest the household priest to win his grace.
