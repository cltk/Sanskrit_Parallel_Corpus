sing strength to indra that shall set his chariot in the foremost place.
giver of room in closest fight slayer of foes in shock of war be thou our great encourager let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies.
thou didst destroy the dragon thou sentest the rivers down to earth.
foeless o indra wast thou born thou tendest well each choicest thing therefore we draw us close to thee let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of feeble enemies.
destroyed be all malignities and all our enemys designs.
thy bolt thou castest at the foe o indra who would srnite us dead thy liberal bounty gives us wealth.
the robber people round about indra who watch and aim at usÂ—.
trample them down beneath thy foot a conquering scatterer art thou.
whoso assails us indra be the man a stranger or akin.
bring down thyself his strength although it be as vast as are the heavens.
close to thy friendship do we cling o indra and depend or thee.
lead us beyond all pain and grief along the path of holy law.
do thou bestow upon us her o indra who yields according to the singers longing.
that the great cow may with exhaustless udder pouring a thousand streams give milk to feed us.
