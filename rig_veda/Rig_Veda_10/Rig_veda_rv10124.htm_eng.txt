come to this sacrifice of ours o agni threefold with seven threads and five divisions.
be our oblationbearer and preceder thou hast lain long enough in during darkness.
i come a god foreseeing from the godless to immortality by secret pathways.
while i ungracious one desert the gracious leave mine own friends and seek the kin of strangers.
looking to the guest of other lineage have founded many a rule of law and order.
i bid farewell to the great god the father and for neglect obtain my share of worship.
i tarried many a year within this altar i leave the father for my choice is indra.
away pass agni varuṇa and soma rule ever changes this i come to favour.
these asuras have lost their powers of magic but thou o varuṇa if thou dost love me.
o king discerning truth and right from falsehood come and be lord and ruler of my kingdom.
here is the light of heaven here allis lovely here there is radiance here is airs wide region.
let us two slaughter vṛtra forth o soma thou art oblation we therewith will serve thee.
the sage hath fixed his form by wisdom in the heavens varuṇa with no violence let the waters flow.
like womenfolk the floods that bring prosperity have eau lit his hue and colour as they gleamed and shone.
these wait upon his loftiest power and vigour he dwells in these who triumph in their godhead.
and they like people who elect their ruler have in abhorrence turned away from vṛtra.
they call him swan the abhorrent floods companion moving in friendship with celestial waters.
the poets in their thought have looked on indra swiftly approaching when anustup calls him.
