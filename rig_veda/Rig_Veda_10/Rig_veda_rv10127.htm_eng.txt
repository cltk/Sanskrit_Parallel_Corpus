with all her eyes the goddess night looks forth approaching many a spot.
she hath put all her glories on.
immortal she hath filled the waste the goddess hath filled height and depth.
she conquers darkness with her light.
the goddess as she comes hath set the dawn her sister in her place.
and then the darkness vanishes.
so favour us this night o thou whose pathways we have visited.
as birds their nest upon the tree.
the villagers have sought their homes and all that walks and all that flies.
even the falcons fain for prey.
keep off the shewolf and the wolf o urmya keep the thief away.
easy be thou for us to pass.
clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest hues.
o morning cancel it like debts.
these have i brought to thee like kine o night thou child of heaven accept.
this laud as for a conqueror.
