with all thy beauty come the kine approaching with full udders follow on thy path.
come with kind thoughts most liberal rousing the warriors hymn of praise with bounteous ones.
as nourishers we tie the thread and liberal with our bounty offer sacrifice.
dawn drives away her sisters gloom and through her excellence makes her retrace her path.
