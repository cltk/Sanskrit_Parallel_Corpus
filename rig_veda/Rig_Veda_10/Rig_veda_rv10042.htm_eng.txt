even as an archer shoots afar his arrow offer the laud to him with meet adornment.
quell with your voice the wickeds voice o sages singer make indra rest beside the soma.
draw thy friend to thee like a cow at milking o singer wake up indra as a lover.
make thou the hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel filled brimful with treasure.
why maghavan do they call thee bounteous giver quicken me thou i hear art he who quickens.
Śakra let my intelligence be active and bring us luck that finds great wealth o indra.
standing in battle for their rights together the people indra in the fray invoke thee.
him who brings gifts the hero makes his comrade with him who pours no juice he seeks not friendship.
whoso with plenteous food for him expresses strong somas as much quicklycoming treasure.
for him he overthrows in early morning his swift wellweaponed foes and slays the tyrant.
he unto whom we offer praises indra maghavan who hath joined to ours his wishes.
before him even afar the foe must tremble low before him must bow all human glories.
with thy fierce bolt o god invoked of many drive to a distance from afar the foeman.
o indra give us wealth in corn and cattle and make thy singers prayer gain strength and riches.
indra the swallower of strong libations rich in the boons they bring the potent somas.
he maghavan will not restrict his bounty he brings much wealth unto the somapresser.
yea by superior play he wins advantage when he a gambler piles his gains in season.
celestialnatured he oerwhelms with riches the devotee who keeps not back his treasure.
o muchinvoked may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle.
may we allied as first in rank with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.
bṛhaspati protect us from the rearward and from above and from below from sinners.
may indra from the front and from the centre as friend to friends vouchsafe us room and freedom.
