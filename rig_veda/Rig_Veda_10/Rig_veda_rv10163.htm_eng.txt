from both thy nostrils from thine eyes from both thine ears and from thy chin.
forth from thy head and brain and tongue i drive thy malady away.
from the necktendons and the neck from the breastbones and from the spine.
from shoulders upper lower arms i drive thy malady away.
from viscera and all within forth from the rectum from the heart.
from kidneys liver and from spleen i drive thy malady away.
from thighs from kneecaps and from heels and from the forepart of the feet.
from hips from stomach and from groin i drive thy malady away.
from what is voided from within and from thy hair and from they nails.
from all thyself from top to toe i drive thy malady away.
from every member every hair disease that comes in every joint.
from all thyself from top to toe i drive thy malady away.
