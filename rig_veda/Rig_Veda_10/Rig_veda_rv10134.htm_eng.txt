as like the morning thou hast filled o indra both the earth and heaven.
so as the mighty one great king of all the mighty world of men the goddess mother brought thee forth the blessed mother gave thee life.
relax that mortals stubborn strength whose heart is bent on wickedness.
trample him down beneath thy feet who watches for and aims at us the goddess mother brought thee forth the blessed mother gave thee life.
shake down o slayer of the foe those great all splendid enemies.
with all thy powers o Śakra all thine helps o indra shake them down.
as thou o Śatakratu thou o indrv shakest all things down.
as wealth for him who sheds the juice with thine assistance thousandfold.
around on every side like drops of sweat let lightningflashes fall.
let all malevolence pass away from us like threads of darva grass.
thou bearest in thine hand a lance like a long hook great counsellor.
as with his foremost foot a goat draw down the branch o maghavan.
never o gods do we offend nor are we ever obstinate we walk as holy texts command.
closely we clasp and cling to you cling to your sides beneath your arms.
