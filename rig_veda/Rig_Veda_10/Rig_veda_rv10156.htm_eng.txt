let songs of ours speed agni forth like a fleet courser in the race.
and we will win each prize through him.
agni the dart whereby we gain kine for ourselves with help from theeÂ—.
that send us for the gain of wealth.
o agni bring us wealth secure vast wealth in horses and in kine.
oil thou the socket turn the wheel.
o agni thou hast made the sun eternal star to mount the sky.
bestowing light on living men.
thou agni art the peoples light best dearest seated in thy shrine.
watch for the singer give him life.
