bring forth your sacred song ye prudent singers even as are the thoughts of human beings.
let us draw indra with true deeds anear us he loves our songs the hero and is potent.
the hymn shone brightly from the seat of worship to the kine came the bull the heifers offipring.
with mighty bellowing hath he arisen and hath pervaded even the spacious regions.
indra knows verily how to hear our singing for he victorious made a path for sūrya.
he made the cow and be became the sovran of heaven primeval matchless and unshaken.
praised by aṅgirases indra demolished with might the works of the great watery monster.
full many regions too hath he pervaded and by his truth supported earths foundation.
the counterpart of heaven and earth is indra he knoweth all libations slayeth Śuṣṇa.
the vast sky with the sun hath he extended and best otpillars stayed it with a pillar.
the vṛtraslaver with his bolt felled vṛtra the magic of the godless waxen mighty.
here hast thou bold assailant boldly conquered yea then thine arms o maghavan were potent.
when the dawns come attendant upon sūrya their rays discover wealth of divers colours.
the star of heaven is seen as twere approaching none knoweth aught of it as it departeth.
far have they gone the first of all these waters the waters that flowed forth when indra sent them.
where is their spring and where is their foundation where now ye waters is your inmost centre.
thou didst free rivers swallowed by the dragon and rapidly they set themselves in motion.
those that were loosed and those that longed for freedom excited now to speed they run unresting.
yearning together they have sped to sindhu the fortdestroyer praised of old hath loved them.
indra may thy terrestrial treasures reach us and our full songs of joy approach thy dwelling.
