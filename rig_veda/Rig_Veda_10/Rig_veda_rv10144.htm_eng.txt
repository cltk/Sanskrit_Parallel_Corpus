this deathless indu like a steed strong and of full vitality.
belongs to thee the orderer.
here by us for the worshipper is the wise bolt that works with skill.
it brings the bubbling beverage as a dexterous man brings the effectual strong drink.
impetuous ahīśuva a bull among cows of his.
looked down upon the restless hawk.
that the strongpinioned bird hath brought child of the falcon from afar.
what moves upon a hundred wheels along the female dragons path.
which fair unrobbed the falcon brought thee in his foot the redhued dwelling of the juice.
through this came vital power which lengthens out our days and kinship through its help awoke.
so indra is by lndus power een among gods will it repel great treachery.
wisdom most sapient one brings force that lengthens life may wisdom bring the juice to us.
