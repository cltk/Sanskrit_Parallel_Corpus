let us with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the gods.
that one may see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.
these brahmaṇaspati produced with blast and smelting like a smith.
existence in an earlier age of gods from nonexistence sprang.
existence in the earliest age of gods from nonexistence sprang.
thereafter were the regions born this sprang from the productive power.
earth sprang from the productive power the regions from the earth were born.
dakṣa was born of aditi and aditi was dakṣas child.
for aditi o dakṣa she who is thy daughter was brought forth.
after her were the blessed gods born sharers of immortal life.
when ye o gods in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood.
thence as of dancers from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.
when o ye gods like yatis ye caused all existing things to grow.
then ye brought sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.
eight are the sons of adid who from her body sprang to life.
with seven she went to meet the gods she cast martanda far away.
so with her seven sons aditi went forth to meet the earlier age.
she brought martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.
