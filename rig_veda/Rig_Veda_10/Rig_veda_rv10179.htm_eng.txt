now lift ye up yourselves and look on indras seasonable share.
if it be ready offer it unready ye have been remise.
oblation is prepared come to us indra the sun hath travelled over half his journey.
friends with their stores are sitting round thee waiting like lords of clans for the tribes wandering chieftain.
dressed in the udder and on fire i fancy welldressed i fancy is this recent present.
drink indra of the curd of noons libation with favour thunderer thou whose deeds are mighty.
