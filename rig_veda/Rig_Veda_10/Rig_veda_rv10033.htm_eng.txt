the urgings of the people have impelled me and bythe nearest way i bring you pūṣan.
the universal gods have brought me safely the cry was heard behold dubsasu cometh.
the ribs that compass me give pain and trouble me like rival wives.
indigence nakedness exhaustion press me sore my mind is fluttering like a birds.
as rats eat weavers threads cares are consuming me thy singer gatakratu me.
have mercy on us once o indra bounteous lord be thou a father unto us.
i the priests Ṛṣi chose as prince most liberal kurusravana.
the son of trasadasyus son.
whose three bays harnessed to the car bear me straight onward i will laud.
the giver of a thousand meeds.
the sire of upamasravas even him whose words were passing sweet.
as a fair field is to its lord.
mark upamasravas his son mark grandson of mitratithi.
i am thy fathers eulogist.
if i controlled immortal gods yea even were i lord of men.
my liberal prince were living still.
none lives even had he hundred lives beyond the statute of the gods.
so am i parted from my friend.
