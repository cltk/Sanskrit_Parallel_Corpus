this pleasant meath o indra is effused for thee thou art the ruling lord of beaker and of juice.
bestow upon us wealth with many hero sons thou having glowed with fervour wonnest heavenly light.
let us call Śakra to libations here effused winner of light who joyeth in the potent juice.
mark well this sacrifice of ours and come to us we pray to maghavan the vanquisher of hosts.
by royal somas and by varuṇas decree under bṛhaspatis and anumatis guard.
this day by thine authority o maghavan maker disposer thou have i enjoyed the jars.
too urged on have had my portion in the bowl and as first prince i drew forth this my hymn of praise.
when with the prize i came unto the flowing juice o viśvāmitra jamadagni to your home.
