this spotted bull hath come and sat before the mother in the east.
advancing to his father heaven.
expiring when he draws his breath she moves along the lucid spheres.
the bull shines out through all the sky.
song is bestowed upon the bird it rules supreme through thirty realms.
throughout the days at break of morn.
