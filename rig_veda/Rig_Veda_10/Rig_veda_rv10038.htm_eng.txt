Śakra may we be thine the friendly conquerors even as we desire o vasu so do thou.
the godless man muchlauded indra whether he be dāsa or be Ārya who would war with us.
easy to conquer he for thee with us these foes with thee may we subdue them in the clash of fight.
him who must be invoked by many and by few who standeth nigh with comfort in the war of men.
indra famed hero winner in the deadly strife let us bring hitherward today to favour us.
for indra i have heard thee called self capturer one steer who never yields who urges even the churl.
release thyself from kutsa and come hither how shall one like thee sit still bound that he may not move.
