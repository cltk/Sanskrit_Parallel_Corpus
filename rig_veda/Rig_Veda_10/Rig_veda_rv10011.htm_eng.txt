the bull hath yielded for the bull the milk of heaven the son of aditi can never be deceived.
according to his wisdom varuṇa knoweth all may he the holy hallow times for sacrifice.
gandharvi spake may she the lady of the flood amid the rivers roaring leave my heart untouched.
may aditi accomplish all that we desire and may our eldest brother tell us this as chief.
yea even this blessed morning rich in store of food splendid with heavenly lustre hath shone out for man.
since they as was the wish of yearning gods brought forth that yearning agni for the assembly as the priest.
and the fleet falcon brought for sacrifice from afar this flowing drop most excellent and keen of sight.
then when the Āryan tribes chose as invoking priest agni the wonderworker and the hymn rose up.
still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass and skilled in sacrifice offers thee holy gifts.
when thou having received the sages strengthening food with lauds after long toil cornest with many more.
urge thou thy parents as a lover  to delight the lovely one desires and craves it from his heart.
the priest calls out the sacrificer shows his skill the asura tries his strength and with the hymn is stirred.
farfamed is he the mortal man o agni thou son of strength who hath obtained thy favour.
he gathering power borne onward by his horses makes his days lovely in his might and splendour.
when holy agni the divine assembly the sacred synod mid the gods is gathered.
and when thou godlike one dealest forth treasures vouchsafe us too our portion of the riches.
hear us o agni in your common dwelling harness thy rapid car of amṛta.
bring heaven and earth the deities parents hither stay with us here nor from the gods be distant.
