with hymns of praise their sons have told aloud the Ṛbhus mighty deeds.
who allsupporting have enjoyed the earth as twere a mother cow.
bring forth the god with song divine being jātavedas hitherward.
to bear our gifts at once to heaven.
he here a goddevoted priest led forward comes to sacrifice.
like a car covered for the road he glowing knows himself the way.
this agni rescues from distress as twere from the immortal race.
a god yet mightier than strength a god who hath been made for life.
