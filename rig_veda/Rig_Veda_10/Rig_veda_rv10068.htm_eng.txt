like birds who keep their watch plashing in water like the loud voices of the thundering raincloud.
like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to bṛhaspati our hymns have sounded.
the son of aṅgirases meeting the cattle as bhaga brought in aryaman among us.
as friend of men he decks the wife and husband as for the race bṛhaspati nerve our coursers.
bṛhaspati having won them from the mountains strewed down like barley out of winnowing baskets.
the vigorous wandering cows who aid the pious desired of all of blameless form wellcoloured.
as the sun dews with meath the seat of order and casts a flaming meteor down from heaven.
so from the rock bṛhaspati forced the cattle and cleft the earths skin as it were with water.
forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness as the gale blows a lily from the fiver.
like the wind grasping at the cloud of vala bṛhaspati gathered to himself the cattle.
bṛhaspati when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling vala.
consumedḥim as tongues cat what teeth have compassed he threw the prisons of the red cows open.
that secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave bṛhaspati discovered.
and drave himself the bright kine from the mountain like a birds young after the eggs disclosure.
he looked around on rockimprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water.
bṛhaspati cleaving through with varied clamour brought it forth like a bowl from out the timber.
he found the light of heaven and fire and morning with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness.
as from a joint bṛhaspati took the marrow of vala as he gloried in his cattle.
as trees for foliage robbed by winter vala mourned for the cows bṛhaspati had taken.
he did a deed neer done neer to be equalled whereby the sun and moon ascend alternate.
like a dark steed adorned with pearl the fathers have decorated heaven with constellations.
they set the light in day in night the darkness bṛhaspati cleft the rock and found the cattle.
this homage have weoffered to the cloud god who thunders out to many in succession.
may this bṛhaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and horses men and heroes.
