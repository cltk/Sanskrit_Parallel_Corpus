he hath attained the skys supremest limits the steer hath waxen in the lap of waters.
the bull the youngling with the hump hath frolicked the strong and neverceasing calf hath bellowed.
bringing our offerings to the gods assembly he moves as chief in his own dwellingplaces.
him who hath grasped his parents head they stablished at sacrifice a wave of heavenly lustre.
in his swift flight the red dawns borne by horses refresh their bodies in the home of order.

for sacrifice seven places thou retainest while for thine own self thou engenderest mitra.
thou art the eye and guard of mighty order and varuṇa when to sacrifice thou comest.
thou art the waters child o jātavedas envoy of him whose offering thou acceptest.
thou art the leader of the rite and region to which with thine auspicious teams thou teadest.
thy lightbestowing head to heaven thou liftest making thy tongue the oblationbearer agni.

carefully tended in his parents bosom calling the weapons kin goes forth to combat.
wellskilled to use the weapons of his father Āptya urged on by indra fought the battle.
then trita slew the foe sevenrayed threeheaded and freed the cattle of the son of tvaṣṭar.
