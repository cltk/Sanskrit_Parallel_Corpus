i balm with oil the mighty rakṣasslayer to the most famous friend i come for shelter.
enkindled sharpened by our rites may agni protect us in the day and night from evil.
o jātavedas with the teeth of iron enkindled with thy flame attack the demons.
seize with thy longue the foolish gods adorers rend put within thy mouth the rawflesh caters.
apply thy teeth the upper and the lower thou who hast both enkindled and destroying.
roam also in the air o king around us and with thy jaws assail the wicked spirits.
bending thy shafts through sacrifices agni whetting their points with song as if with whetstones.
pierce to the heart therewith the yātudhānas and break their arms uplifed to attack thee.
pierce through the yātudhānas skin o agni let the destroying dart with fire consume him.
rend his joints jātavedas let the cater of flesh fleshseeking track his mangled body.
where now thou seest agni jātavedas one of these demons standing still or roaming.
or flying on those paths in airs midregion sharpen the shaft and as an archer pierce him.
tear from the evil spirit jātavedas what he hath seized and with his spears hath captured.
blazing before him strike him down o agni let spotted carrioneating kites devour him.
here tell this forth o agni whosoever is he himself or acteth as a demon.

with keen glance guard the sacrifice o agni thou sage conduct it onward to the vasus.

look on the fiend mid men as manbeholder rend thou his three extremities in pieces.
demolish with thy flame his ribs o agni the yātudhānas root destroy thou triply.
thrice agni let thy noose surround the demon who with his falsehood injures holy order.
loud roaring with thy flame o jātavedas crush him and cast him down before the singer.
lead thou the worshipper that eye o agni wherewith thou lookest on the hoofarmed demon.
with light celestial in atharvans manner burn up the foot who ruins truth with falsehood.
agni what curse the pair this day have uttered what heated word the worshippers have spoken.
each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spiritpierce to the heart therewith the yātudhānas.
with fervent heat exterminate the demons destroy the fiends with burning flame o agni.
destroy with fire the foolish gods adorers blaze and destrepy the insatiable monsters.
may gods destroy this day the evildoer may each hot curse of his return and blast him.
let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals and visvas net enclose the yātudhāna.
the fiend who smears himself with flesh of cattle with flesh of horses and of human bodies.
who steals the milchcows milk away o agnitear off the heads of such with fiery fury.
the cow gives milk each year o manregarder let not the yātudhāna ever taste it.
if one would glut him with the biesting agni pierce with thy flame his vitals as he meets thee.
let the fiends drink the poison of the cattle may aditi cast off the evildoers.
may the god savitar give them up to ruin and be their share of plants and herbs denied them.
agni from days of old thou slayest demons never shall rākṣasas in fight oercome thee.
burn up the foolish ones the fleshdevourers let none of them escape thine heavenly arrow.

we set thee round us as a fort victorious agni thee a sage.
of hero lineage day by day destroyer of our treacherous foes.
burn with thy poison turned against the treacherous brood of rākṣasas.
o agni with thy sharpened glow with lances armed with points of flame.
burn thou the paired kimīdins brun agni the yātudhāna pairs.
i sharpen thee infallible with hymns o sage be vigilant.
shoot forth o agni with thy flame demolish them on every side.
break thou the yātudhānas strength the vigour of the rākṣasa.
