agni refulgent among men thou slayest the devouring fiend.
bright ruler in thine own abode.
thou springest up when worshipped well the drops of butter are thy joy.
when ladies are brought near to thee.
honoured with gifts he shines afar agni adorable with song.
the dripping ladle balms his face.
agni with honey in his mouth honoured with gifts is balmed with oil.
refulgent in his wealth of light.
praised by our hymns thou kindlest thee oblationbearer for the gods.
as such do mortals call on thee.
to that immortal agni pay worship with oil ye mortal men.
lord of the house whom none deceives.
o agni burn the rākṣasas with thine unconquerable flame.
shine guardian of eternal law.
so agni with thy glowing face burn fierce against the female fiends.
shining among uruksayas.
uruksayas have kindled thee oblationbearer thee with hymns.
best worshipper among mankind.
