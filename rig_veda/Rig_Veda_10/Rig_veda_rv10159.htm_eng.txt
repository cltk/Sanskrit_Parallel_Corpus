yon sun hath mounted up and this my happy fate hate mounted high.
i knowing this as conqueror have won my husband for mine own.
i am the banner and the head a mighty arbitress am i.
i am victorious and my lord shall be submissive to my will.
my sons are slayers of the foe my daughter is a ruling queen.
i am victorious oer my lord my song of triumph is supreme.
oblation that which indra gave and thus grew glorious and most high.
this have i offered o ye gods and rid me of each rival wife.
destroyer of the rival wife sole spouse victorious conqueror.
the others glory have i seized as twere the wealth of weaker dames.
i have subdued as conqueror these rivals these my fellowwives.
that i may hold imperial sway over this hero and the folk.
