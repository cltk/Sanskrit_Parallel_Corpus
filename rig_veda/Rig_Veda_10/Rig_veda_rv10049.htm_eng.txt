i have enriched the singer with surpassing wealth i have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me.
i furtherer of him who offers sacrifice have conquered in each fight the men who worship not.
the people of the heavens the waters and the earth have stablished me among the gods with indras name.
i took unto myself the two swift vigorous bays that speed on divers paths and the fierce bolt for strength.
with deadly blows i smote atka for kavis sake i guarded kutsa well with these saving helps.
as Śuṣṇas slayer i brandished the dart of death i gave not up the Āryan name to dasyu foes.
smadibha tugra and the vetasus i gave as prey to kutsa fatherlike to succour him.
i was a worthy king to rule the worshipper when i gave tuji dear inviolable gifts.
i gave up mṛgaya to srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws.
for Āyus sake i caused veta to bend and bow and into savyas hand delivered padgrbhi.
i crushed navavāstva of the lofty car the dāsa as the vṛtraslayer kills the fiends.
when straightway on the regions farthest edge i brought the god who makes the lights to broaden and increase.
i travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleetfooted dappled horses of the sun.
when mans libation calls me to the robe of state i soon repel the powerful dasyu with my blows.
stronger am i than nabus i who slew the seven i glorified with might yadu and turvaga.
i brought another low with strength i bent his strength i let the mighty nineandninety wax in power.
bull over all the streams that flow along the earth i took the seven rivers as mine own domain.
i gifted with great wisdom spread the floods abroad by war i found for man the way to high success.
i set within these cows the white milk which no god not even tvaṣṭars self had there deposited.
muchlongedfor in the breasts the udders of the kine the savoury sweets of meath the milk and soma juice.
even thus hath indra maghavan truly bounteous sped gods and men with mighty operation.
the pious glorify all these thine exploits lord of bay coursers strong and selfresplendent.
