gods whatsoeÂ’er the dove came hither seeking sent to us as the envoy of destruction.
for that let us sing hymns and make atonement well be it with our quadrupeds and bipeds.
auspicious be the dove that hath been sent us a harmless bird ye gods within our dwelling.
may agni sage be pleased with our oblation and may the missile borne on wings avoid us.
let not the arrow that hath wings distract us beside the fireplace on the hearth it settles.
may it bring welfare to our men and cattle here let the dove ye gods forbear to harm us.
the screeching of the owl is ineffective and when beside the fire the dove hath settled.
to him who sent it hither as an envoy to him be reverence paid to death to yama.
drive forth the dove chase it with holy verses rejoicing bring ye hither food and cattle.
barring the way against all grief and trouble let the swift bird fly forth and leave us vigour.
