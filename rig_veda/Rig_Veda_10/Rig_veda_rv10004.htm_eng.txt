to thee will send praise and bring oblation as thou hast merited lauds when we invoked thee.
a fountain in the desert art thou agni o ancient king to man who fain would worship.
thou unto whom resort the gathered people as the kine seek the warm stall o most youthful.
thou art the messenger of gods and mortals and goest glorious with thy light between them.
making thee grow as twere some noble infant thy mother nurtures thee with sweet affection.
over the desert slopes thou passest longing and seekest like some beast set free thy fodder.
foolish are we o wise and free from error verily agni thou dost know thy grandeur.
there lies the form he moves and licks and swallows and as houselord kisses the youthful maiden.
he rises ever fresh in ancient fuel smokebannered gray he makes the wood his dwelling.
no swimmer steer he presses through the waters and to his place accordant mortals bear him.
like thieves who risk their lives and haunt the forest the twain with their ten girdles have secured him.
this is a new hymn meant for thee o agni yoke as it were thy car with parts that glitter.
homage and prayer are thine o jātavedas and this my song shall evermore exalt thee.
agni protect our children and descendants and guard with everwatcliful care our bodies.
