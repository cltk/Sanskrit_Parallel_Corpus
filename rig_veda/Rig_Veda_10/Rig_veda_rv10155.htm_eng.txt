arayi oneeyed limping hag fly everscreeching to the hill.
we frighten thee away with these the heroes of sirimbitha.
scared from this place and that is she destroyer of each germ unborn.
go sharphorned brāhmaṇaspti and drive arayi far away.
yon log that floats without a man to guide it on the rivers edge.
seize it thou thing with hideous jaws and go thou far away thereon.
when foul with secret stain and spot ye hastened onward to the breast.
all indras enemies were slain and passed away like froth and foam.
these men have led about the cow have duly carried agni round.
and raised their glory tg the gods who will attack them with success.
