i am prepared to laud with song or worship the noble ones who are in earth and heaven.
or coursers who have triumphed in the contest or those who famed have won the prize with glory.
their call the call of gods went up to heaven they kissed the ground with gloryseeking spirit.
there where the gods look on for happy fortune and like the kindly heavens bestow their bounties.
this is the song of those immortal beings who long for treasures in their full perfection.
may these completing prayers and sacrifices bestow upon us wealth where naught is wanting.
those living men extolled thy deed o indra those who would fain burst through the stall of cattle.
fain to milk her who bare but once great lofty whose sons are many and her streams past number.
sacivan win to your assistance indra who never bends who overcomes his foemen.
Ṛbhukṣan maghavan the hymns upholder who rich in food bears mans kind friend the thunder.
since he who won of old anew hath triumphed indra hath earned his name of vṛtraslaycr.
he hath appeared the mighty lord of conquest what we would have him do let him accomplish.
