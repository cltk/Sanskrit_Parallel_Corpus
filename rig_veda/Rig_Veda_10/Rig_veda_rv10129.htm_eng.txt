then was not nonexistent nor existent there was no realm of air no sky beyond it.
what covered in and where and what gave shelter was water there unfathomed depth of water.
death was not then nor was there aught immortal no sign was there the days and nights divider.
that one thing breathless breathed by its own nature apart from it was nothing whatsoever.
darkness there was at first concealed in darkness this all was indiscriminated chaos.
all that existed then was void and form less by the great power of warmth was born that unit.
thereafter rose desire in the beginning desire the primal seed and germ of spirit.
sages who searched with their hearts thought discovered the existents kinship in the nonexistent.
transversely was their severing line extended what was above it then and what below it.
there were begetters there were mighty forces free action here and energy up yonder.
who verily knows and who can here declare it whence it was born and whence comes this creation.
the gods are later than this worlds production who knows then whence it first came into being.
he the first origin of this creation whether he formed it all or did not form it.
whose eye controls this world in highest heaven he verily knows it or perhaps he knows not.
