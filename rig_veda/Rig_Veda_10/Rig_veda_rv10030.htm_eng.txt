as twere with swift exertion of the spirit let the priest speed to the celestial waters.
the glorious food of varuṇa and mitra to him who spreadeth far this laud i offer.
adhvaryus he ye ready with oblations and come with longing to the longing waters.
down on which looks the purpletinted eagle pour ye that flowing wave this day defthanded.
go to the reservoir o ye adhvaryus worship the waters child with your oblations.
a consecrated wave he now will give you so press for him the soma rich in sweetness.
he who shines bright in floods unfed with fuel whom sages worship at their sacrifices.
give waters rich in sweets child of the waters even those which gave heroic might to indra.
those in which soma joys and is delighted as a young man with fair and pleasant damsels.
go thou unto those waters o adhvaryu and purify with herbs what thou infusest.
so maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them who yearn to meet him.
in heart accordant and in wish oneminded are the adhvaryus and the heavenly waters.
he who made room for you when fast imprisoned who freed you from the mighty imprecation.
even to that indra send the meathrich current the wave that gratifies the gods o waters.
send forth to him the meathrich wave o rivers which is your offspring and a well of sweetness.
oilbalmed to be implored at sacrifices ye wealthy waters hear mine invocation.
send forth the rapturegiving wave o rivers which indra drinks which sets the twain in motion.
the well that springeth from the clouds desirous that wandereth tripleformed distilling transport.
these winding streams which with their double current like cattleraiders seek the lower pastures.
waters which dwell together thrive together queens mothers of the world these Ṛṣi honour.
send forth our sacrifice with holy worship send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches.
for need of sacrifice disclose the udder give gracious hearing to our call o waters.
for wealthy waters ye control all treasures ye bring auspicious intellect and amṛta.
ye are the queens of independent riches sarasvatī give full life to the singer.
when i behold the waters coming hither carrying with them milk and mcath and butter.
bearing the wellpressed soma juice to indra they harmonize in spirit with adhvaryus.
rich they are come with wealth for living beings o friends adhvaryus seat them in their places.
seat them on holy grass ye somabringers in harmony with the offspring of the waters.
now to this grass are come the longing waters the pious ones are seated at our worship.
adbvaryus press the soma juice for indra so will the service of the gods be easy.
