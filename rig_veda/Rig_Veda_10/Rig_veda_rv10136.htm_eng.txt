he with the long loose locks supports agni and moisture heaven and earth.
he is all sky to look upon he with long hair is called this light.
the munis girdled with the wind wear garments soiled of yellow hue.
they following the winds swift course go where the gods have gone before.
transported with our munihood we have pressed on into the winds.
you therefore mortal men behold our natural bodies and no more.
the muni made associate in the holy work of every god.
looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air.
the steed of vāta vāyus friend the muni by the gods impelled.
in both the oceans hath his home in eastern and in western sea.
treading the path of sylvan beasts gandharvas and apsarases.
he with long locks who knows the wish is a sweet most delightful friend.
vāyu hath churned for him for him he poundeth things most hard to bend.
when he with long loose locks hath drunk with rudra water from the cup.
