let these speak loudly forth let us speak out aloud to the loud speaking pressingstones address the speech.
when rich with soma juice stones of the mountain ye united swift to indra bring the sound of praise.
they speak out like a hundred like a thousand men they cry aloud to us with their greentinted mouths.
while pious stones they ply their task with piety and even before the hotar taste the offered food.
loudly they speak for they have found the savoury meath they make a humming sound over the meat prepared.
as they devour the branch of the redcoloured tree these the wellpastured bulls have uttered bellowings.
they cry aloud with strong exhilarating drink calling on indra now for they have found the meath.
bold with the sisters they have danced embraced by them making the earth reecho with their ringing sound.
the eagles have sent forth their cry aloft in heaven in the skys vault the dark impetuous ones have danced.
then downward to the nether stones fixt place they sink and splendid as the sun effuse their copious stream.
like strong ones drawing they have put forth all their strength the bulls harnessed together bear the chariotpoles.
when they have bellowed panting swallowing their food the sound of their loud snorting is like that of steeds.
to these who have ten workers and a tenfold girth to these who have ten yokestraps and ten binding thongs.
to these who bear ten reins the eternal sing ye praise to these who bear ten carpoles ten when they are yoked.
these stones with ten conductors rapid in their course with lovely revolution travel round and round.
they have been first to drink the flowing soma juice first to enjoy the milky fluid of the stalk.
these somaeaters kiss indras baycoloured steeds draining the stalk they sit upon the oxs hide.
indra when he hath drunk somameath drawn by them waxes in strength is famed is mighty as a bull.
strong is your stalk ye verily never shall be harmed ye have refreshment ye are ever satisfied.
fair are ye as it were through splendour of his wealth his in whose sacrifice o stones ye find delight.
bored deep but not pierced through with holes are ye o stones not loosened never weary and exempt from death.
eternal undiseased moving in sundry ways unthirsting full of fatness void of all desire.
your fathers verily stand firm from age to age they loving rest are not dissevered from their seat.
untouched by time neÂ’er lacking green plants and green trees they with their voice have caused the heavens and earth to hear.
this this the stones proclaim what time they are disjoined and when with ringing sounds they move and drink the balm.
like tillers of the ground when they are sowing seed they mix the soma nor devouring minish it.
they have raised high their voice for juice for sacrifice striking the mother earth as though they danced thereon.
so loose thou too his thought who hath effused the sap and let the stones which we are honouring be disjoined.
