i sing thy fame that maghavan through thy greatness the heavens and earth invoked thee in their terror.
thou aiding gods didst quell the power of dāsas what time thou holpest many a race o indra.
when thou wast roaming waxen strong in body telling thy might indra among the people.
all that men called thy battles was illusion no foe hast thou today nor erst hast found one.
who are the Ṛṣis then who comprehended before our time the bounds of all thy greatness.
for from thy body thou hast generated at the same time the mother and the father.
thou mighty steer hast four supremest natures asura natures that may neer be injured.
all these o maghavan thou surely knowest wherewith thou hast performed thy great achievements.
thou hast all treasures in thy sole possession treasures made manifest and treasures hidden.
defer not thou o maghavan my longing thou art director indra thou art giver.
to him who set the light in things of splendour and with all sweetness blent essential sweetness.
to indra hath this welcome hymn that strengthens been uttered by the votary bṛhaduktha.
