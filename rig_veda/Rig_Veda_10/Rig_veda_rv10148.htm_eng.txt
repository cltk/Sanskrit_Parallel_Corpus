when we have pressed the juice we laud thee indra and when most valorous we have won the booty.
bring us prosperity as each desires it under thine own protection may we conquer.
sublime from birth mayst thou o indra hero with sūrya overcome the dāsa races.
as by a fountains side we bring the soma that lay concealed closehidden in the waters.
answer the votarys hymns for these thou knowest craving the Ṛṣis prayer thyself a singer.
may we be they who take delight in somas these with sweet food for thee o chariotrider.
these holy prayers o indra have i sung thee grant to the men the strength of men thou hero.
be of one mind with those in whom thou joyest keep thou the singers safe and their companions.
listen to pṛthis call heroic indra and be thou lauded by the hymns of venya.
him who hath sung thee to thine oilrich dwelling whose rolling songs have sped thee like a torrent.
