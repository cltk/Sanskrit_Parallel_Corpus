i was the first possessor of all precious gear the wealth of every man i win and gather up.
on me as on a father living creatures call i deal enjoyment to tho man who offers gifts.
i indra am atharvans stay and firm support i brought forth kine to trita from the dragons grasp.
i stripped the dasyus of their manly might and gave the cattlestalls to matarigvan and dadhyac.
for me hath tvaṣṭar forged the iron thunderbolt in me the gods have centred intellectual power.
my sheen is like the suns insufferably bright men honour me as lord for past and future deeds.
i won myself these herdi of cattle steeds and kine and gold in ample store with my destructive bolt.
i give full many a thousand to the worshipper what time the somas and the lauds have made me glad.
indra am i none ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am i a thrall to death.
pressing the soma ask riches from me alone ye pūrus in my friendship shall not suffer harm.
these breathing loud in fury two and two who caused indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray.
the challengers i struck with deadly weapon down firm stand what words the god speaks to his worshippers.
this one by stronger might i conquered singly yea also two shall three prevail against me.
like many sheaves upon the floor i thrash them how can my foes the indraless revile me.
against the gungus i made atithigva strong and kept him mid the folk like vṛtraconquering strength.
when i won glory in the great foeslaying fight in battle where karanja fell and parṇaya.
with food for mine enjoyment sapya nami came he joined me as a friend of old in search of kine.
as i bestowed on him an arrow for the fight i made him worthy of the song apd hymn of praise.
one of the two hath soma seen within it the herdsman with the bone shows forth the other.
he fain to fight the bull whose horns were sharpened stood fettered in the demons ample region.
i as a god neer violate the statutes of gods of vasus rudriyas Ādityas.
these gods have formed me for auspicious vigour unconquered and invincible for ever.
