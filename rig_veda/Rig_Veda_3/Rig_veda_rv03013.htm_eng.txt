to agni to this god of yours i sing aloud with utmost power.
may he come to us with the gods and sit best offerer on the grass.
the holy whose are earth and heaven and succour waits upon his strength.
him men who bring oblations laud and they who wish to gain for grace.
he is the sage who guides these men leader of sacred rites is he.
him your own agni serve ye well who winneth and bestoweth wealth.
so may the gracious agni grant most goodly shelter for our use.
whence in the heavens or in the floods he shall pour wealth upon our lands.
the singers kindle him the priest agni the lord of tribes of men.
resplendent and without a peer through his own excellent designs.
help us thou brahman best of all invokers of the gods in song.
beam friend of maruts bliss on us o agni a most liberal god.
yea grant us treasure thousandfold with children and with nourishment.
and agni splendid hero strength exalted wasting not away.
