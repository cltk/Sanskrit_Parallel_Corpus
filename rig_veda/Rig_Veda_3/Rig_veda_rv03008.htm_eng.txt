godserving men o sovran of the forest with heavenly meath at sacrifice anoint thee.
grant wealth to us when thou art standing upright as when reposing on this mothers bosom.
set up to eastward of the fire enkindled accepting prayer that wastes not rich in hero.
driving far from us poverty and famine lift thyself up to bring us great good fortune.
lord of the forest raise thyself up on the loftiest spot of earth.
give splendour fixt and measured well to him who brings the sacrifice.
wellrobed enveloped he is come the youthful springing to life his glory waxeth greater.
contemplative in mind and godadoring sages of high intelligence upraise him.
sprung up he rises in the days fair weather increasing in the menfrequented synod.
with song the wise and skilful consecrate him his voice the godadoring singer utters.
ye whom religious men have firmly planted thou forest sovran whom the axe hath fashioned.
let those the stakes divine which here are standing be fain to grant us wealth with store of children.
o men who lift the ladles up these hewn and planted in the ground.
bringing a blessing to the field shall bear our precious gift to gods.
Ādityas rudras vasus careful leaders earth heaven and prthivi and airs midregion.
accordant deities shall bless our worship and make our sacrifices ensign lofty.
like swans that flee in lengthened line the pillars have come to us arrayed in brilliant coiour.
they lifted up on high by sages eastward go forth as gods to the gods dwellingplaces.
those stakes upon the earth with rings that deck them seem to the eye like horns of horned creatures.
or as upraised by priests in invocation let them assist us in the rush to battle.
lord of the wood rise with a hundred branches with thousand branches may we rise to greatness.
tlou whom this hatchct with an edge well whetted for great felicity hath brought before us.
