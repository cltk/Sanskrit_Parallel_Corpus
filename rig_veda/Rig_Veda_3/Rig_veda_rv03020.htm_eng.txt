with lauds at break of morn the priest invoketh agni dawn dadhikrās and both the aśvins.
with one consent the gods whose light is splendid longing to taste our sacrifice shall hear us.
three are thy powers o agni three thy stations three are thy tongues yea many child of order.
three bodies hast thou which the gods delight in with these protect our hymns with care unceasing.
o agni many are the names thou bearest immortal god divine and jātavedas.
and many charms of charmers allinspirer have they laid in thee lord of true attendants.
agni like bhaga leads the godly people he who is true to law and guards the seasons.
ancient allknowing he the vṛtraslayer shall bear the singer safe through every trouble.
i call on savitar the god on morning bṛhaspati and dadhikrās and agni.
on varuṇa and mitra on the aśvins bhaga the vasus rudras and Ādityas.
