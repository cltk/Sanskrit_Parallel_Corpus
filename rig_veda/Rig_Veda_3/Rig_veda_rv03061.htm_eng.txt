o uṣas strong with strength endowed witli knowledge accept the singers praise o wealthy lady.
thou goddess ancient young and full of wisdom movest allbounteous as the law ordaineth.
shine forth o morning thou auspicious goddess on thy bright car awaking pleasant voices.
let docile horses of farreaching splendour convey thee hitherward the goldencoloured.
thou morning turning thee to every creature standest on high as ensign of the immortal.
to one same goal ever and ever wending now like a wheel o newlyborn roll hi ther.
letting her reins drop downward morning cometh the wealthy dame the lady of the dwelling.
bringing forth light the wonderful the blessed hath spread her from the bounds of earth and heaven.
hither invoke the radiant goddess morning and bring with reverence your hymn to praise her.
she dropping sweets hath set in heaven her brightness and fair to look on hath beamed forth her splendour.
from heaven with hymns the holy one was wakened brightly to both worlds came the wealthy lady.
to morning agni when she comes refulgent thou goest forth soliciting fair riches.
on laws firm base the speeder of the mornings the bull hath entered mighty earth and heaven.
great is the power of varuṇa and mitra which bright hath spread in every place its splendour.
