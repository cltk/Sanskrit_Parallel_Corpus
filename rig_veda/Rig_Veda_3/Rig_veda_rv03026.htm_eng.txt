revering in our heart agni vaiśvānara the finder of the light whose promises are true.
the liberal gladsome carborne god we kuśikas invoke him with oblation seeking wealth with songs.
that agni bright vaiśvānara we invoke for help and mātariśvan worthy of the song of praise.
bṛhaspati for mans observance of the gods the singer prompt to hear the swiftlymoving guest.
age after age vaiśvānara neighing like a horse is kindled with the women by the kuśikas.
may agni he who wakes among immortal gods grant us heroic strength and wealth in noble steeds.
let them go forth the strong as flames of fire with might gathered for victory they have yoked their spotted deer.
pourers of floods the maruts masters of all wealth they who can neer be conquered make the mountains shake.
the maruts friends of men are glorious as the fire their mighty and resplendent succour we implore.
those storming sons of rudra clothed in robes of rain boongivers of good gifts roar as the lions roar.
we band on band and troop following troop entreat with fair lauds agnis splendour and the maruts might.
with spotted deer for steeds with wealth that never fails they wise ones come to sacrifice at our gatherings.
agni am i who know by birth all creatures mine eye is butter in my mouth is nectar.
i am light threefold measurer of the region exhaustless heat am i named burntoblation.
bearing in mind a thought with light accordant he purified the sun with three refinings.
by his own nature gained the highest treasure and looked abroad over the earth and heaven.
the spring that fails not with a hundred streamlets father inspired of prayers that men should utter.
the sparkler joyous in his parents bosorn him the truthspeaker sate ye earth and heaven.
