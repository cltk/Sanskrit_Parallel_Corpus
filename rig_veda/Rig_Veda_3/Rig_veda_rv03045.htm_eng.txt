come hither indra with bay steeds joyous with tails like peacocks plumes.
let no men cheek thy course as fowlers stay the bird pass oer them as oer desert lands.
he who slew vṛtra burst the cloud brake the strongholds and drave the floods.
indra who mounts his chariot at his bay steeds cry shatters een things that stand most firm.
like pools of water deep and full like kine thou cherishest thy might.
like the milchcows that go wellguarded to the mead like waterbrooks that reach the lake.
bring thou us wealth with power to strike our share gainst him who calls it his.
shake indra as with hooks the tree for ripened fruit for wealth to satisfy our wish.
indra selfruling lord art thou good leader of most glorious fame.
so waxen in thy strength o thou whom many praise be thou most swift to hear our call.
