here is your ghostly kinship here o men they came desirous to these holy rites with store of wealth.
with wondrous arts whereby with schemes to meet each need ye gained sudhanvans sons your share in sacrifice.
the mighty powers wherewith ye formed the chalices the thought by which ye drew the cow from out the hide.
the intellect wherewith ye wrought the two bay steedsthrough these o Ṛbhus ye attained divinity.
friendship with indra have the Ṛbhus fully gained grandsons of manu they skilfully urged the work.
sudhanvans children won them everlasting life serving with holy rites pious with noble acts.
in company with indra come ye to the juice then gloriously shall your wishes be fulfilled.
not to be paragoned ye priests are your good deeds nor your heroic acts Ṛbhus sudhanvans sons.
o indra with the Ṛbhus mighty ones pour down the soma juice effused wellblent from both thy hands.
maghalan urged by song in the drinkofferers house rejoice thee with the heroes with sudhanvans sons.
with Ṛbhu near and vāja indra here exult with saci praised of many in the juice we pour.
these homes wherein we dwell have turned themselves to thee devotions to the gods as laws of men ordain.
come with the mighty Ṛbhus indra come to us strengthening with thy help the singers holy praise.
at hundred eager calls come to the living man with thousand arts attend the act of sacrifice.
