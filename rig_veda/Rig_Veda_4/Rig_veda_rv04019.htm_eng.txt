thee verily o thunderwielding indra all the gods here the helpers swift to listen.
and both the worlds elected thee the mighty high waxen strong alone to slaughter vṛtra.
the gods as worn witheld relaxed their efforts thou indra born of truth wast sovran ruler.
thou slewest ahi who besieged the waters and duggest out their allsupporting channels.
the insatiate one extended hard to waken who slumbered in perpetual sleep o indra.
the dragon stretched against the seven prone rivers where no joint was thou rentest with thy thunder.
indra with might shook earth and her foundation as the wind stirs the water with its fury.
striving with strength he burst the firm asunder and tore away the summits of the mountains.
they ran to thee as mothers to their offspring the clouds like chariots hastened forth together.
thou didst refresh the streams and force the billows thou indra settest free obstructed rivers.
thou for the sake of vayya and turvīti didst stay the great stream flowing allsustaining.
yea at their prayer didst check the rushing river and make the floods easy to cross o indra.
he let the young maids skilled in law unwedded like fountains bubbling flow forth streaming onward.
he inundated thirsty plains and deserts and milked the dry cows of the mighty master.
through many a morn and many a lovely autumn having slain vṛtra he set free the rivers.
indra hath set at liberty to wander on earth the streams encompassed pressed together.
lord of bay steeds thou broughtest from the anthill the unwedded damsels son whom ants were eating.
the blind saw clearly as he grasped the serpent rose brake the jar his joints again united.
to the wise man o sage and sovran ruler the man who knoweth all thine ancient exploits.
hath told these deeds of might as thou hast wrought them great acts spontaneous and to mans advantage.
now indra lauded glorified with praises let powers swell high like rivers for the singer.
for thee a new hymn lord of bays is fashioned may we carborne through song be victors ever.
