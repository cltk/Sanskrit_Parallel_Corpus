this day with praises agni we bring thee that which thou lovest.
right judgment like a horse with our devotions.
for thou hast ever been the cardriver agni of noble.
strength lofty sacrifice and rightful judgment.
through these our praises come thou to meet us bright as the sunlight.
o agni well disposed with all thine aspects.
now may we serve thee singing these lauds this day to thee agni.
loud as the voice of heaven thy blasts are roaring.
just at this time of the day and the night thy look is the sweetest.
it shineth near us even as gold for glory.
spotless thy body brilliant as gold like clarified butter.
this gleams like gold on thee o self dependent.
all hate and mischief yea if committed agni thou turnest.
holy one from the man who rightly worships.
agni with you gods prosperous be our friendships and kinships.
be this our bond here by this place thine altar.
