windsped the skillful ones in rapid motion have in an instant compassed round the heaven.
what time the rbus had with care and marvels done proper service to assist their parents.
they won the friendship of the gods the sages carried away the fruit of their devotion.
may they who made their parents who were lying like posts that moulder young again for ever.
may vāja vibhvan Ṛbhu joined with indra  protect our sacrifice the somalovers.

and through a years space still sustained her brightness through these their labours they were made immortal.
two beakers let us makethus said the eldest let us make threethis was the youngers sentence.
four beakers let us makethus spoke the youngest tvaṣṭar approved this rede of yours o Ṛbhus.

therefore do ye who are so great o Ṛbhus vouchsafe us treasures at this third libation.
