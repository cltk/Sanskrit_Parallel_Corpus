agni the herald like a horse is led forth at our solemn rite.
god among gods adorable.
three times unto our solemn rite comes agni like a charioteer.
bearing the viands to the gods.
round the oblations hath he paced agni the wise the lord of strength.
giving the offerer precious boons.
he who is kindled eastward for sṛñjaya devāvatas son.
resplendent tamer of the foe.
so mighty be the agni whom the mortal hero shall command.
with sharpened teeth and bountiful.
day after day they dress him as they clean a horse who wins the prize.
dress the red scion of the sky.
when sahadevas princely son with two bay horses thought of me.
summoned by him i drew not back.
and truly those two noble bays i straightway took when offered me.
from sahadevas princely son.
long o ye aśvins may he live your care ye gods the princely son.
of sahadeva somaka.
cause him the youthful prince the son of sahadeva to enjoy.
long life o aśvins o ye gods.
