come to our sacrifice vājas Ṛbhukṣans gods by the paths which gods are wont to travel.
as ye gay gods accept in splendid weather the sacrifice among these folk of manus.
may these rites please you in your heart and spirit may the drops clothed in oil this day approach you.
may the abundant juices bear you onward to power and strength and when imbibed delight you.
your threefold going near is godappointed so praise is given you vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.
so manuslike mid younger folk i offer to you who are aloft in heaven the soma.
strong with fair chains of gold and jaws of iron ye have a splendid car and wellfed horses.
ye sons of strength ye progeny of indra to you the best is offered to delight you.
Ṛbhukṣans him for handy wealth the mightiest comrade in the fight.
him indras equal we invoke most bounteous ever rich in steeds.
the mortal man whom Ṛbhus ye and indra favour with your help.
must be successful by his thoughts at sacrifice and with the steed.
o vājas and Ṛbhukṣans free for us the paths to sacrifice.
ye princes lauded that we may press forward to each point of heaven.
o vājas and Ṛbhukṣans ye nāsatyas indra bless this wealth.
and before other mens the steed that ample riches may be won.
