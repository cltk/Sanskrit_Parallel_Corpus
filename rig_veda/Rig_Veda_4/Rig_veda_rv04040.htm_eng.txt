let us recite the praise of dadhikrāvan may all the mornings move me to exertion.
praise of the lord of waters dawn and agni bṛhaspati son of aṅgiras and sūrya.
brave seeking war and booty dwelling with the good and with the swift may he hasten the food of dawn.
may he the true the fleet the lover of the course the birdlike dadhikrāvan bring food strength and light.
his pinion rapid runner fans him m his way as of a bird that hastens onward to its aim.
and as it were a falcons gliding through the air strikes dadhikrāvans side as he speeds on with might.
bound by the neck and by the flanks and by the mouth the vigorous courser lends new swiftness to his speed.
drawing himself together as his strength allows dadhikrās springs along the windings of the paths.
the haṁsa homed in light the vasu in midair the priest beside the altar in the house the guest.
dweller in noblest place mid men in truth in sky born of flood kine truth mountain he is holy law.
