great art thou indra yea the earth with gladness and heaven confess to thee thine high dominion.
thou in thy vigour having slaughtered vṛtra didst free the floods arrested by the dragon.
heaven trembled at the birth of thine effulgence earth trembled at the fear of thy displeasure.
the stedfast mountains shook in agitation  the waters flowed and desert spots were flooded.
hurling his bolt with might he cleft the mountain while putting forth his strength he showed his vigour.
he slaughtered vṛtra with his bolt exulting and their lord slain forth flowed the waters swiftly.
thy father dyaus esteemed himself a hero most noble was the work of indras maker.
his who begat the strong bolts lord who roareth immovable like earth from her foundation.
he who alone oerthrows the world of creatures indra the peoples king invoked of many.
verily all rejoice in him extolling the boons which maghavan the god hath sent them.
all soma juices are his own for ever most gladdening draughts are ever his the mighty.
thou ever wast the treasurelord of treasures indra thou lettest all folk share thy bounty.
moreover when thou first wast born o indra thou struckest terror into all the people.
thou maghavan rentest with thy bolt the dragon who lay against the waterfloods of heaven.
the everslaying bold and furious indra the bright bolts lord infinite strong and mighty.
who slayeth vṛtra and acquireth booty giver of blessings maghavan the bounteous.
alone renowned as maghavan in battles he frighteneth away assembled armies.
he bringeth us the booty that he winneth may we wellloved continue in his friendship.
renowned is he when conquering and when slaying fis he who winneth cattle in the combat.
when indra hardeneth his indignation all that is fixed and all that moveth fear him.
indra hath won all kine all gold all horsesmaghavan he who breaketh forts in pieces.
most manly with these men of his who help him dealing out wealth and gathering the treasure.
what is the care of indra for his mother what cares he for the father who begat him.
his care is that which speeds his might in conflicts like wind borne onward by the clouds that thunder.
maghavan makes the settled man unsettled he scatters dust that he hath swept together.
breaking in pieces like heaven armed with lightning maghavan shall enrich the man who lauds hm.
he urged the chariotwheel of sūrya forward etaśa speeding on his way he rested.
him the black undulating cloud bedeweth in this midairs depth at the base of darkness.
as in the night the sacrificing priest.
eager for booty craving strength and horses wesingers stir indra the strong for friendship.
who gives the wives we seek whose succour fails not to hasten like a pitcher to the fountain.
be thou our guardian show thyself our kinsman watching and blessing those who pour the soma.
as friend as sire most fatherly of fathers giving the suppliant vital strength and freedom.
be helping friend of those who seek thy friendship  give life when lauded indra to the singer.
for indra we the priests have paid thee worship exalting thee with these our sacrifices.
alone when indra maghavan is lauded he slayeth many neerresisted vṛtras.
him in whose keeping is the wellloved singer never do gods or mortals stay or hinder.
een so let maghavan the loudvoiced indra give us true blessings foeless mens upholder.
king of all creatures give us glory amply exalted glory due to him who lauds thee.
now indra lauded glorified with praises let power swell high like rivers for the singer.
for thee a new hymn lord of bays is fashioned may we carborne through song be victors ever.
