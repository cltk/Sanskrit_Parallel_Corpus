come lauded unto us with powers and succours o indra with thy tawny steeds exulting.
past even the foemans manifold libations glorified with our hymns true wealthbestower.
mans friend to this our sacrifice he cometh marking how he is called by somapressers.
fearless and conscious that his steeds are noble he joyeth with the somapouring heroes.
make his cars hear that he may show his vigour and may be joyful in the way he loveth.
may mighty indra pouring forth in bounty bestow on us good roads and perfect safety.
he who with succour comes to his implorer the singer here who with his song invites him.
he who himself sets to the pole swift coursers he who hath hundreds thousands thunderwielder.
o indra maghavan by thee protected may we be thine princes and priests and singers.
sharing the riches sent from lofty heaven which yields much food and all desire its bounty.
