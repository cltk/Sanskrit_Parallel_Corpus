what laud o indravaruṇa with oblation hath like the immortal priest obtained your favour.
hath our effectual laud addressed with homage touched you o indravaruṇa in spirit.
he who with dainty food hath won you indra and varuṇa gods as his allies to friendship.
slayeth the vṛtras and his foes in battles and through your mighty favours is made famous.
indra and varuṇa are most liberal givers of treasure to the men who toil to serve them.
when they as friends inclined to friendship honoured with dainty food delight in flowing soma.
indra and varuṇa ye hurl o mighty on him your strongest flashing bolt of thunder.
who treats us ill the robber and oppressor measure on him your overwhelming vigour.
o indravaruṇa be ye the lovers of this my song as steers who love the milchcow.
milk may it yield us as gone forth to pasture the great cow pouring out her thousand rivers.
for fertile fields for worthy sons and grandsons for the suns beauty and for steerlike vigour.
may indravaruṇa with gracious favours work marvels for us in the stress of battle.
for you as princes for your ancient kindness good comrades of the man who seeks for booty.
we choose to us for the dear bond of friendship most liberal heroes bringing bliss like parents.
showing their strength these hymns for grace freegivers i have gone to you devoted as to battle.
for glory have they gone as milk to soma to indravaruṇa my thoughts and praises.
to indra and to varuṇa desirous of gaining wealth have these my thoughts proceeded.
they have come nigh to you as treasurelovers like mares fleetfooted eager for the glory.
may we ourselves be lords of during riches of ample sustenance for car and hones.
so may the twain who work with newest succours bring yoked teams hitherward to us and riches.
come with your mighty succours o ye mighty come indravaruṇa to us in battle.
what time the flashing arrows play in combat may we through you be winners in the contest.
