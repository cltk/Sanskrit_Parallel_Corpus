v훮yu the bright is offered thee best of the meath at holy rites.
come thou to drink the soma juice god longedfor on thy teamdrawn car.
o v훮yu thou and indra are meet drinkers of these somadraughts.
for unto you the drops proceed as waters gather to the vale.
o indrav훮yu mighty twain speeding together lords of strength.
come to our succour with your team that ye may drink the soma juice.
the longedfor teams which ye possess o heroes for the worshipper.
turn to us indrav훮yu ye to whom the sacrifice is paid.
