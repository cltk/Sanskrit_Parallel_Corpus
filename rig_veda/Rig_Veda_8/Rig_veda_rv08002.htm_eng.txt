here is the soma juice expressed o vasu drink till thou art full.
undaunted god we give it thee.
washed by the men pressed out with stones strained through the filter made of wool.
tis like a courser bathed in stream.
this juice have we made sweet for thee like barley blending it with milk.
indra i call thee to our feast.
beloved of all indra alone drinks up the flowing soma juice.
among the gods and mortal men.
the friend whom not the brillianthued the badlymixt or bitter draught.
repels the farextending god.
while other men than we with milk chase him as hunters chase a deer.
and with their kine inveigle him.
for him for indra for the god be pressed three draughts of soma juice.
in the juicedrinkers own abode.
three reservoirs exude their drops filled are three beakers to the brim.
all for one offering to the god.
pure art thou set in many a place and blended in the midst with milk.
and curd to cheer the hero best.
here indra are thy somadraughts pressed out by us the strong the pure.
they crave admixture of the milk.
o indra pour in milk prepare the cake and mix the somadraught.
i hear them say that thou art rich.
quaffed juices fight within the breast the drunken praise not by their wine.
the naked praise not when it rains.
rich be the praiser of one rich munificent and famed like thee.
high rank be his o lord of bays.
foe of the man who adds no milk he heeds not any chanted hymn.
or holy psalm that may he sung.
give us not indra as a prey unto the scornful or the proud.
help mighty one with power and might.
this even this o indra we implore as thy devoted friends.
the kaṇvas praise thee with their hymns.
naught else o thunderer have i praised in the skilled singers eulogy.
on thy land only have i thought.
the gods seek him who presses out the soma they desire not sleep.
they punish sloth unweariedly.
come hither swift with gifts of wealth  be not thou angry with uslike.
a great man with a youthful bride.
let him not wrathful with us spend the evening far from us today.
like some unpleasant soninlaw.
for well we know this heros love most liberal of the boons he gives.
his plans whom the three worlds display.
pour forth the gift which kaṇvas bring for none more glorious do we know.
than the strong lord with countless aids.
o presser offer soma first to indra hero Śakra him.
the friend of man that he may drink.
who in untroubled ways is best provider for his worshippers.
of strength in horses and in kine.
pressers for him blend soma juice each draught most excellent for him.
the brave the hero for his joy.
the vṛtraslayer drinks the juice may he who gives a hundred aids.
approach nor stay afar from us.
may the strong bay steeds yoked by prayer bring hither unto us our friend.
lover of song renowned by songs.
sweet are the soma juices come blent are the soma juices come.
Ṛṣilike mighty fair of cheek come hither quickly to the feast.
and lauds which strengthen thee for great bounty and valour and exalt.
indra who doeth glorious deeds.
and songs to thee who lovest song and all those hymns addressed to thee.
these evermore confirm thy might.
thus he sole doer of great deeds whose hand holds thunder gives us strength.
he who hath never been subdued.
vṛtra he slays with his right hand even indra great with mighty power.
and muchinvoked in many a place.
he upon whom all men depend all regions all achievements he.
takes pleasure in our wealthy chiefs.
all this hath he accomplished yea indra most gloriously renowned.
who gives our wealthy princes strength.
who drives his chariot seeking spoil from afar to him he loves.
for swift is he to bring men wealth.
the sage who winning spoil with steeds slays vṛtra hero with the men.
his servants faithful succourer.
o priyamedhas worship with collected mind this indra whom.
the soma hath full well inspired.
ye kaṇvas sing the mighty one lord of the brave who loves renown.
allpresent glorified by song.
strong friend who with no trace of feet restores the cattle to the men.
who rest their wish and hope on him.
shaped as a ram stonehurler i once thou camest hither to the son.
of kaṇva wise medhyātithi.
vibhindu thou hast helped this man giving him thousands four times ten.
and afterward eight thousand more.
and these twain pouring streams of milk creative daughters of delight.
for wedlock sake i glorify.
