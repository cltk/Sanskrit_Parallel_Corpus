ye twain are priests of sacrifice winners in war and holy works.
indra and agni mark this well.
ye bounteous riders on the car ye vṛtraslayers unsubdued.
indra and agni mark this well.
the men with pressingstones have pressed this meath of yours which gives delight.
indra and agni mark this well.
accept our sacrifice for weal sharers of praise the soma shed.
indra and agni heroes come.
be pleased with these libations which attract you to our sacred gifts.
indra and agni heroes come.
accept this eulogy of mine whose model is the gāyatrī.
indra and agni heroes come.
come with the earlyfaring gods ye who are lords of genuine wealth.
indraagni to the somadraught.
hear ye the call of atris hear Śyāvāśva as he sheds the juice.
indraagni to the somadraught.
thus have i called you to our aid as sages called on you of old.
indraagni to the soma draught.
indras and agnis grace i claim sarasvatīs associates.
to whom this psalm of praise is sung.
