cheif priest is agni at the laud as stones and grass at sacrifice.
with song i seek the maruts brahmaṇaspati gods for help much to be desired.
i sing to cattle and to earth to trees to dawns to night to plants.
o all ye vasus ye possessors of all wealth be ye the furtherers of our thoughts.
forth go with agni to the gods our sacrifice of ancient use.
to the Ādityas varuṇa whose law stands fast and the alllightening marut troop.
lords of all wealth may they be strengtheners of man destroyers of his enemies.
lords of all wealth do ye with guards which none may harm preserve our dwelling free from foes.
come to us with one mind today come to us all with one accord.
maruts with holy song and goddess aditi mighty one to our house and home.
send us delightful things ye maruts on your steeds come ye o mitra to our gifts.
let indra varuṇa and the Ādityas sit swift heroes on our sacred grass.
we who have trimmed the grass for you and set the banquet in array.
and pressed the soma call you varuina like men with sacrificial fires aflame.
o maruts visinu aśvins pūṣan haste away with minds turned hitherward to me.
let the strong indra famed as vṛtras slayer come first with the winners of the spoil.
ye guileless gods bestow on us a refuge strong on every side.
a sure protection vasus unassailable from near at hand or from afar.
kinship have i with you and close alliance o ye gods destroyers of our foes.
call us to our prosperity of former days and soon to new klicity.
for now have i sent forth to you that i may win a fair reward.
lords of all wealth with homage this my song of praise like a milchcow that faileth not.
excellent savitar hath mounted up on high for you ye sure and careful guides.
bipeds and quadrupeds with several hopes and aims and birds have settled to their tasks.
singing their praise with godlike thought let us invoke each god for grace.
each god to bring you help each god to strengthen you.
for of one spirit are the gods with mortal man cosharers all of gracious gifts.
may they increase our strength hereafter and today providing case and ample room.
i laud you o ye guileless gods here where we meet to render praise.
none varuṇa and mitra harins the mortal man who honours and obeys your laws.
he makes his house endure he gathers plenteous food who pays obedience to your will.
born in his sons anew he spreads as law commands and prospers every way unharmed.
een without war he gathers wealth and goes hisway on pleasant paths.
whom mitra varuṇa and aryaman protect sharing the giftof one accord.
een on the plain for him ye make a sloping path an easy way where road is none.
and far away from him the ineffectual shaft must vanish shot at him in vain.
if ye appoint the rite today kind rulers when the sun ascends.
lords of all wealth at sunset or at wakingtime or be it at the noon of day.
or asuras when ye have sheltered the worshipper who goes to sacrifice at eve.
may we o vasus ye possessors of all wealth come then into the midst of you.
if ye today at sunrise or at noon or in the gloom of eve.
lords of all riches give fair treasure to the man the wise man who hath sacrificed.
then we imperial rulers claim of you this boon your wide protection as a son.
may we Ādityas offering holy gifts obtain that which shall bring us greater bliss.
