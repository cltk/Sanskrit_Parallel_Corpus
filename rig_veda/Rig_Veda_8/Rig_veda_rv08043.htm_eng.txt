these songs of mine go forth as lauds of agni the disposing sage.
whose worshipper is neer oerthrown.
wise agni jātavedas i beget a song of praise for thee.
who willingly receivest it.
thy sharpened flames o agni like the gleams of light that glitter through.
devour the forests with their teeth.
goldcoloured bannered with the smoke urged by the wind aloft to heaven.
rise lightly borne the flames of fire.
these lightly kindled fiery flames are all around made visible.
even as the gleanings of the dawns.
as jātavedas speeds along the dust is black beneath his feet.
when agni spreads upon the earth.
making the plants his nourishment agni devours and wearies not.
seeking the tender shrubs again.
bending him down with all his tongues he flickers with his fiery glow.
splendid is agni in the woods.
agni thine home is in the floods into the plants thou forcest way.
and as their child art born anew.
worshipped with offerings shines thy flame o agni from the sacred oil.
with kisses on the ladles mouth.
let us serve agni with our hymns disposer fed on ox and cow.
who bears the soma on his back.
yea thee o agni do we seek with homage and with fuel priest.
whose wisdom is most excellent.
o worshipped with oblations pure agni we call on thee as erst.
did bhṛgu manus aṅgiras.
for thou o agni by the fire sage by the sage good by the good.
friend by the friend art lighted up.
so wealth in thousands food with store of heroes give thou to the sage.
o agni to the worshipper.
o agni brother made by strength lord of red steeds and brilliant sway.
take pleasure in this laud of mine.
my praises agni go to thee as the cows seek the stall to meet.
the lowing calf that longs for milk.
agni best aṅgiras to thee all people who have pleasant homes.
apart have turned as to their wish.
the sages skilled in holy song and thinkers with their thoughts have urged.
agni to share the sacred feast.
so agni unto thee the priest invoker strong in forays pray.
those who spin out the sacrifice.
in many a place the same in look art thou a prince oer all the tribes.
in battles we invoke thine aid.
pray thou to agni pray to him who blazes served with sacred oil.
let him give ear to this our call.
we call on thee as such as one who hears as jātavedas one.
agni who beats away our foes.
i pray to agni king of men the wonderful the president.
of holy laws may he give ear.
him like a bridegroom him who stirs all people like a noble horse.
like a fleet steed we instigate.
slaying things deadly burning up foes rākṣasas on every side.
shine agni with thy sharpened flame.
thou whom the people kindle even as manus did best aṅgiras.
o agni mark thou this my speech.
o agni made by strength be thou born in the heavens or born in floods.
as such we call on thee with songs.
yea all the people all the folk who have good dwellings each apart.
send food for thee to eat thereof.
o agni so may we devout gazed at by men throughout our days.
pass lightly over all distress.
we venerate with cheerful hearts the cheerful agni dear to all.
burning with purifying flame.
so thou o agni rich in light beaming like sūrya with thy rays.
boldly demolishest the gloom.
we pray to thee for this thy gift victor the gift that faileth not.
o agni choicest wealth from thee.
