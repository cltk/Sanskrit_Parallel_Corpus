the priests of him the lofty priest wellskilled in hymns harness their spirit yea harness their holy thoughts.
he only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks yea lofty is the praise of savitar the god.
the sapient one arrays himself in every form for quadruped and biped he hath brought forth good.
excellent savitar hath looked on heavens high vault and shineth after the outgoing of the dawn.
even he the god whose goingforth and majesty the other deities have followed with their might.
he who hath measured the terrestrial regions out by his great power he is the courser savitar.
to the three spheres of light thou goest savitar and with the rays of sidrya thou combinest thee.
around on both sides thou encompassest the night yea thou o god art mitra through thy righteous laws.
over all generation thou art lord alone pūṣan art thou o god in all thy goingsforth.
yea thou hast domination over all this world Śyāvāśva hath brought praise to thee o savitar.
