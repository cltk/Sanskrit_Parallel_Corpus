o agni be our nearest friend be thou a kind deliverer and a gracious friend.
excellent agni come thou nigh to us and give us wealth most splendidly renowned.
so hear us listen to this call of ours and keep us far from every sinful man.
to thee then o most bright o radiant god we come with prayer for happiness for our friends.
