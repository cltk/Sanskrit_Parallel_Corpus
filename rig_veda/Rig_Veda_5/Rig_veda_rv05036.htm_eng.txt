may indra come to us he who knows rightly to give forth treasures from his store of riches.
even as a thirsty steer who roams the deserts may he drink eagerly the milkedout soma.
lord of bay horses hero may the soma rise to thy cheeks and jaws like mountainridges.
may we o king as he who driveth coursers all joy in thee with hymns invoked of many.
invoked of many caster of the stone my heart quakes like a rolling wheel for fear of penury.
shall not puruvasu the singer give thee praise o everprospering maghavan mounted on thy car.
like the pressstone is this thy praiser indra loudly he lifts his voice with strong endeavour.
with thy left hand o maghavan give us riches with thy right lord of bays be not reluctant.
may the strong heaven make thee the strong wax stronger strong thou art borne by thy two strong bay horses.
so fair of cheek with mighty chariot mighty uphold us strongwilled thunderarmed in battle.
maruts let all the people in obeisance bow down before this youthful srutaratha.
who rich in steeds gave me two dark red horses together with three hundred head of cattle.
