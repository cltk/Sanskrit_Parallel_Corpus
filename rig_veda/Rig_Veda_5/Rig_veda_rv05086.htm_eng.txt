the mortal man whom ye the twain indra and agni help in fight.
breaks through een stronglyguarded wealth as tṛta burst his way through reeds.
the twain invincible in war worthy to be renowned in frays.
lords of the fivefold people these indra and agni we invoke.
impetuous is their strength and keen the lightning of the mighty pair.
which from their arms speeds with the car to vṛtras slayer for the kine.
indra and agni we invoke you both as such to send your cars.
lords of quickcoming bounty ye who know chief lovers of the song.
these who give increase day by day gods without guile for mortal man.
worthy themselves i honour most two gods as partners for my horse.
the strengthbestowing offering thus to indraagni hath been paid as butter purified by stones.
deal to our princes high renown deal wealth to those who sing your praise deal food to those who sing your praise.
