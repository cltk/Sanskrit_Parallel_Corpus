indra for our assistance bring that most effectual power of thine.
which conquers men for us and wins the spoil invincible in fight.
indra whatever aids be thine four be they or o hero three.
or those of the five tribes of men bring quickly all that help to us.
the aid most excellent of thee the mightiest hitherward we call.
for thou wast born with hero might conquering indra with the strong.
mighty to prosper us wast thou born and mighty is the strength thou hast.
in native power thy soul is firm thy valour indra slays a host.
o Śatakratu lord of strength o indra caster of the stone.
with all thy chariots force assail the man who shows himself thy foe.
for mightiest vṛtraslayer thee fierce foremost among many folk.
whose sacred grass is trimmed invite to battle where the spoil is won.
indra do thou protect our car that mingles foremost in the fights.
that bears its part in every fray invincible and seeking spoil.
come to us indra and protect our car with thine intelligence.
may we o mightiest one obtain excellent fame at break of day and meditate our hymn at dawn.
