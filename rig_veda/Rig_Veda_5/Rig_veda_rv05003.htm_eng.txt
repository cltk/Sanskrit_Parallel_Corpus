thou at thy birth art varuṇa o agni when thou art kindled thou becomest mitra.
in thee o son of strength all gods are centred indra art thou to man who brings oblation.
aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious is thy name o selfsustainer.
as a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou makest wife and lord oneminded.
the maruts deck their beauty for thy glory yea rudra for thy birth fair brightlycoloured.
that which was fixed as viṣṇus loftiest stationtherewith the secret of the cows thou guardest.
gods through thy glory god who art so lovely granting abundant gifts gained life immortal.
as their own priest have men established agni and serve him fain for praise from him who liveth.
there is no priest more skilled than thou in worship none selfsustainer pass thee in wisdom.
the man within whose house as guest thou dwellest o god by sacrifice shall conquer mortals.
aided by thee o agni may we conquer through our oblation fain for wealth awakened.
may we in battle in the days assemblies o son of strength by riches conquer mortals.
he shall bring evil on the evilplotter whoever turns against us sin and outrage.
destroy this calumny of him o agni whoever injures us with doubledealing.
at this dawns flushing god our ancient fathers served thee with offerings making thee their envoy.
when agni to the store of wealth thou goest a god enkindled with good things by mortals.
save thou who knowest draw thy father near thee who counts as thine own son o child of power.
o sapient agni when wilt thou regard us when skilled in holy law wilt thou direct us.
adoring thee he gives thee many a title when thou good lord acceptest this as father.
and doth not agni glad in strength of godhead gain splendid bliss when he hath waxen mighty.
most youthful agni verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all his troubles.
thieves have been seen by us and open foemen unknown have been the plottings of the wicked.
to thee these eulogies have been directed or to the vasu hath this sin been spoken.
but this our agni flaming high shall never yield us to calumny to him who wrongs us.
