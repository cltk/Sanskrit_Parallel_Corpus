first worship those who come at early morning let the twain drink before the giftless niggard.
the aśvins claim the sacrifice at daybreak the sages yielding the first share extol them.
worship at dawn and instigate the aśvins nor is the worshipper at eve rejected.
besides ourselves another craves and worships each first in worship is most highly favoured.
covered with gold meathtinted dropping fatness your chariot with its freight of food comes hither.
swift as thought aśvins rapid as the tempest wherewith ye travel over all obstructions.
he who hath served most often the nāsatyas and gives the sweetest food at distribution.
furthers with his own holy works his offspring and ever passes those whose flames ascend not.
may we obtain the aśvins newest favour and gain their healthbestowing happy guidance.
bring riches hither unto us and heroes and all felicity and joy immortals.
