agni the bright face of the dawns is shining the singers pious voices have ascended.
borne on your chariot aśvins turn you hither and come unto our full and rich libation.
most frequent guests they scorn not what is ready even now the lauded aśvins are beside us.
with promptest aid they come at morn and evening the worshippers most blessed guards from trouble.
yea come at milkingtime at early morning at noon of day and when the sun is setting.
by day by night with favour most auspicious not only now the draught hath drawn the aśvins.
for this place aśvins was of old your dwelling these were your houses this your habitation.
come to us from high heaven and from the mountain come from the waters bringing food and vigour.
may we obtain the aśvins newest favour and gain their healthbestowing happy guidance.
bring riches hither unto us and heroes and all felicity and joy immortals.
