to agni lofty asura meet for worship steer of eternal law my prayer i offer.
i bring my song directed to the mighty like pure oil for his mouth at sacrifices.
mark the law thou who knowest yea observe it send forth the full streams of eternal order.
i use no sorcery with might or falsehood the sacred law of the red steer i follow.
how hast thou follower of the law eternal become the knower of a new song agni.
the god the guardian of the seasons knows me the lord of him who won this wealth i know not.
who agni in alliance with thy foeman what splendid helpers won for them their riches.
agni who guard the dwellingplace of falsehood who are protectors of the speech of liars.
agni those friends of thine have turned them from thee gracious of old they have become ungracious.
they have deceived themselves by their own speeches uttering wicked words against the righteous.
he who pays sacrifice to thee with homage o agni keeps the red steers law eternal.
wide is his dwelling may the noble offspring of nahuá¹£a who wandered forth come hither.
