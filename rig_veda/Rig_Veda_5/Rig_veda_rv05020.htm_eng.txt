agni best winner of the spoil cause us to praise before the gods.
as our associate meet for lauds wealth which thou verily deemest wealth.
agni the great who ward not off the anger of thy power and might.
stir up the wrath and hatred due to one who holds an alien creed.
thee agni would we choose as priest the perfecter of strength and skill.
we who bring sacred food invoke with song thee chief at holy rites.
here as is needful for thine aid we toil o conqueror day by day.
for wealth for law may we rejoice most wise one at the feast with kine rejoice with heroes at the feast.
