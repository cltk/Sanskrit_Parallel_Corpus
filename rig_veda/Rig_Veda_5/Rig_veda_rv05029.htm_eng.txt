mans worship of the gods hath three great lustres and three celestial lights have they established.
the maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee for thou o indra art their sapient Ṛṣi.
what time the maruts sang their song to indra joyous when he had drunk of soma juices.
he grasped his thunderbolt to slay the dragon and loosed that they might flow the youthful waters.
and o ye brahmans maruts so may indra drink draughts of this my carefully pressed soma.
for this oblation found for man the cattle and indra having quaffed it slew the dragon.
then heaven and earth he sundered and supported wrapped even in these he struck the beast with terror.
so indra forced the engulfer to disgorgement and slew the dānava panting against him.
thus all the gods o maghavan delivered to thee of their free will the draught of soma.
when thou for etaśa didst cause to tarry the flying mares of sūrya racing forward.
when maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nineandninety castles all together.
the maruts where they met glorified indra ye with the tṛṣṭup hymn obstructed heaven.
as friend to aid a friend agni dressed quickly three hundred buffaloes even as he willed it.
and indra from mans gift for vṛtras slaughter drank ofr at once three lakes of pressedout soma.
when thou three hundred buffaloes flesh hadst eaten and drunk as maghavan three lakes of soma.
all the gods raised as twere a shout of triumph to indra praise because he slew the dragon.
what time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding o uśanā and indra to the dwelling.
thou camest thither conquering together with kutsa and the gods thou slewest Śuṣṇa.
one carwheel of the sun thou rolledst forward and one thou settest free to move for kutsa.
thou slewest noseless dasyus with thy weapon and in their home oerthrewest hostile speakers.
the lauds of gauriviti made thee mighty to vidathins son as prey thou gavest pipru.
rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food and thou hast drunk his soma.
navagvas and dasgvas with libations of soma juice sing hymns of praise to indra.
labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of kine though firmly closed and fastened.
how shall i serve thee maghavan though knowing full well what hero deeds thou hast accomplished.
and the fresh deeds which thou wilt do most mighty these too will we tell forth in sacred synods.
resistless from of old through hero courage thou hast done all these many acts o indra.
what thou wilt do in bravery thunderwielder none is there who may hinder this thy prowess.
indra accept the prayers which now are offered accept the new prayers mightiest which we utter.
like fair and wellmade robes i seeking riches as a deft craftsman makes a car have wrought them.
