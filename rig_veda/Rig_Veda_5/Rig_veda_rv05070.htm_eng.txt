even far and wide o varuṇa and mitra doth your grace extend.
may i obtain your kind goodwill.
from you benignant gods may we gain fully food for sustenance.
such o ye rudras my we be.
guard us o rudras with your guar4 save us ye skilled to save my we.
subdue the dasyus we ourselves.
or neer may we o wondrous strong enjoy anothers solemn feast.
ourselves our sons or progeny.
