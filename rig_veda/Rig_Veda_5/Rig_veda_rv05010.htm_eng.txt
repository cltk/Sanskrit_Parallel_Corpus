bring us most mighty splendour thou agni resistless on thy way.
with overflowing store of wealth mark out for us a path to strength.
ours art thou wondrous agni by wisdom and bounteousness of power.
the might of asuras rests on thee like mitra worshipful in act.
agni increase our means of life increase the house and home of these.
the men the princes who have won great riches through our hymns of praise.
bright agni they who deck their songs for thee have horses as their meed.
the men are mighty in their might they whose high laud as that of heaven awakes thee of its own accord.
o agni those resplendent flames of thine go valorously forth.
like lightnings flashing round us like a rattling car that seeks the spoil.
now agni come to succour us let priests draw nigh to offer gifts.
and let the patrons of our rites subdue all regions of the earth.
bring to us agni aá¹…giras lauded of old and lauded now.
invoker wealth to quell the strong that singers may extol thee be near us in fight for our success.
