who knows the birth of these or who lived in the maruts favour in the days of old.
what time their spotted deer were yoked.
who when they stood upon their cars hath heard them tell the way they went.
who was the bounteous man to whom their kindred rains flowed down with food of sacrifice.
to me they told it and they came with winged steeds radiant to the draught.
youths heroes free from spot or stain behold us here and praise thou us.
who shine selfluminous with ornaments and swords with breastplates armlets and with wreaths.
arrayed on chariots and with bows.
o swift to pour your bounties down ye maruts with delight i look upon your cars.
like splendours coming through the rain.
munificent heroes they have cast heavens treasury down for the worshippers behoof.
they set the stormcloud free to stream through both the worlds and rainfloods flow oer desert spots.
the bursting streams m billowy flood have spread abroad like milchkine oer the firmament.
like swift steeds hasting to their journeys restingplace to every side run glittering brooks.
hither o maruts come from heaven from midair or from near at hand.
tarry not far away from us.
so let not rasā krumu or anitabha kubha or sindhu hold you back.
let not the watery sarayti obstruct your way with us be all the bliss ye give.
that brilliant gathering of your cars the company of maruts of the youthful ones.
the rainshowers speeding on attend.
with eulogies and hymns may we follow your army troop by troop and band by band.
and company by company.
to what oblationgiver sprung of noble ancestry have sped.
the maruts on this course today.
vouchsafe to us the bounty that which we implore through which for child and progeny.
ye give the seed of corn that wasteth not away and bliss that reacheth to all life.
may we in safety pass by those who slander us leaving behind disgrace and hate.
maruts may we be there when ye at dawn in rest and toil rain waters down and balm.
favoured by gods shall he the man o heroes marutr and possessed of noble sons.
whom ye protect such may we be.
praise the freegivers at this liberal patrons rite they joy like cattle in the mead.
so call thou unto them who come as ancient friends hymn those who love thee with a song.
