ye aśvins hither come to us nāsatyas be not disinclined.
fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
o aśvins like a pair of deer like two wild cattle to the mead.
fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
o aśvins rich in gifts accept our sacrifice to prosper it.
fly hither like two swans unto the juice we shed.
as atri when descending to the cavern called on you loudly like a wailing woman.
ye came to him o aśvins with the freshest and most auspicious fleetness of a falcon.
tree part asunder like the side of her who bringeth forth a child.
ye aśvins listen to my call loose saptavadhri from his bonds.
for saptavadhri for the seer affrighted when he wept and wailed.
ye aśvins with your magic powers rent up the tree and shattered it.
like as the wind on every side ruffles a pool of lotuses.
so stir in thee the babe unborn so may the tenmonth babe descend.
like as the wind like as the wood like as the sea is set astir.
so also tenmonth babe descend together with the afterbirth.
the child who hath for ten months time been lying in his mothers side.
may he come forth alive unharmed yea living from the living dame.
