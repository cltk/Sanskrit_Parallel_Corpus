sing forth a hymn sublime and solemn grateful to glorious varuṇa imperial ruler.
who hath struck out like one who slays the victim earth as a skin to spread in front of sūrya.
in the treetops the air he hath extended put milk in kine and vigorous speed in horses.
set intellect in hearts fire in the waters siurya in heaven and soma on the mountain.
varuṇa lets the big cask opening downward flow through the heaven and earth and airs midregion.
therewith the universes sovran waters earth as the shower of rain bedews the barley.
when varuṇa is fain for milk he moistens the sky the land and earth to her foundation.
then straight the mountains clothe them in the raincloud the heroes putting forth their vigour loose them.
i will declare this mighty deed of magic of glorious varuṇa the lord immortal.
who standing in the firmament hath meted the earth out with the sun as with a measure.
none verily hath ever let or hindered this the most wise gods mighty deed of magic.
whereby with all their flood the lucid rivers fill not one sea wherein they pour their waters.
if we have sinned against the man who loves us have ever wronged a brother friend or comrade.
the neighbour ever with us or a stranger o varuṇa remove from us the trespass.
if we as gamesters cheat at play have cheated done wrong unwittingly or sinned of purpose.
cast all these sins away like loosened fetters and varuṇa let us be thine own beloved.
