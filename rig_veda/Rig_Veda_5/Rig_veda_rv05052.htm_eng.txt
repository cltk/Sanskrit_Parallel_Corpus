sing boldly forth Śyāvāśva with the maruts who are loud in song.
who holy as their wont is joy in glory that is free from guile.
for in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic strength.
they in their course boldspirited guard all men of their own accord.
like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights.
and thus the maruts power in heaven and on the earth we celebrate.
with boldness to your maruts let us offer laud and sacrifice.
who all through ages of mankind guard mortal man from injury.
praiseworthy givers of good gifts heroes with full and perfect strength.
to maruts holy ones of heaven will i extol the sacrifice.
the lofty heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming gold.
after these maruts followed close like laughing lightning from the sky a splendour of its own accord.
they who waxed mighty of the earth they who are in the wide midair.
or in the rivers compass or in the abode of ample heaven.
praise thou the maruts company the valorous and truly strong.
the heroes hasting by themselves have yoked their deer for victory.
fairgleaming on paruṣṇī they have clothed themselves in robes of wool.
and with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their might.
whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path.
under these names the spreading band tend well the sacrifice for me.
to this the heroes well attend well do their teams attend to this.
visible are their varied forms behold they are paravatas.
hymnsinging seeking water they praising have danced about the spring.
what are they unto me no thieves but helpers splendid to behold.
sublime with lightnings for their spears sages and orderers are they.
Ṛṣi adore that marut host and make them happy with thy song.
Ṛṣi invite the marut band with offerings as a maid her friend.
from heaven too bold ones in your might haste hither glorified with songs.
thinking of these now let him come as with the escort of the gods.
and with the splendid princes famed for rapid courses to the gifts.
princes who when i asked their kin named pṛśni as their mothercow.
and the impetuous rudra they the mighty ones declared their sire.
the mighty ones the seven times seven have singly given me hundred gifts.
i have obtained on yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds.
