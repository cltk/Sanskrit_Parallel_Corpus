like atri viśvasāman sing to him of purifying light.
who must be praised in holy rites the priest most welcome in the house.
set jātavedas in his place agni the god and minister.
let sacrifice proceed today duly comprising all the gods.
all mortals come to thee for aid the god of most observant mind.
of thine excelling favour we bethink us as we long for it.
mark with attention this our speech o agni thou victorious one.
thee strongjawed as the homesteads lord the atris with their lauds exalt the atris beautify with songs.
