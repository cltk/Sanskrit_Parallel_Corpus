i will sing near for grace your god agni for he is good to us.
son of the brands may he give gifts and righteous save us from the foe.
for he is true whom men of old enkindled and the gods themselves.
the priest with the delicious tongue rich with the light of glorious beams.
with wisdom that surpasseth all with gracious will most excellent.
o agni worthy of our choice shine wealth on us through hymns of praise.
agni is king for he extends to mortals and to gods alike.
agni is bearer of our gifts worship ye agni with your thoughts.
agni gives to the worshipper a son the best of mightiest fame.
of deep devotion neÂ’er subdued bringer of glory to his sire.
agni bestows the herolord who conquers with the men in fight.
agni bestows the fleetfoot steed the victor never overcome.
the mightiest song is agnis shine on high thou who art rich in light.
like the chief consort of a king riches and strength proceed from thee.
resplendent are thy rays of light loud is thy voice like pressingstones.
yea of itself thy thunder goes forth like the roaring of the heaven.
thus seeking riches have we paid homage to agni conqueror.
may he most wise as with a ship carry us over all our foes.
