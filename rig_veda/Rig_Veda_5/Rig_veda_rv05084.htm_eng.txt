thou of a trutho prthivi bearest the tool that rends the hills.
thou rich in torrents who with might quickenest earth o mighty one.
to thee o wanderer at will ring out the lauds with beams of day.
who drivest like a neighing steed the swelling cloud o bright of hue.
who graspest with thy might on earth eÂ’en the strong sovrans of the wood.
when from the lightning of thy cloud the rainfloods of the heaven descend.
