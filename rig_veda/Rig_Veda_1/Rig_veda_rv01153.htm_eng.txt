we worship with our reverence and oblations you mitra varuṇa accordant mighty.
so that with us ye twain whose backs are sprinkled with oil the priests with oil and hymns support you.
your praise is like a mighty power an impulse to you twain gods a wellformed hymn is offered.
as the priest decks yon strong ones in assemblies and the prince fain to worship you for blessings.
o mitravaruṇa aditi the milchcow streams for the rite for folk who bring oblation.
when in the assembly he who worships moves you like to a human priest with gifts presented.
so may the kine and heavenly waters pour you sweet drink in families that make you joyful.
of this may he the ancient houselord give us enjoy drink of the milk the cow provideth.
