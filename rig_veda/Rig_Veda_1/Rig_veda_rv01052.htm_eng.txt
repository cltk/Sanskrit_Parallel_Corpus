i glorify that ram who finds the light of heaven whose hundred noblynatured ones go forth with him.
with hymns may i turn hither indra to mine aidthe car which like a strong steed hasteth to the call.
like as a mountain on firm basis unremoved he thousandfold protector waxed in mighty strength.
when indra joying in the draughts of soma juice forced the clouds slaying vṛtra stayer of their flow.
for he stays een the stayers spread oer laden cloud rooted in light strengthened in rapture by the wise.
indra with thought with skilled activity i call most liberal giver for he sates him with the juice.
whom those that flow in heaven on sacred grass his own assistants noblynatured fill full like the sea.
beside that indra when he smote down vṛtra stood his helpers straight in form mighty invincible.
to him as in wild joy he fought with him who stayed the rain his helpers sped like swift streams down a slope.
when indra thunderarmed made bold by soma draughts as tṛta cleaveth valas fences cleft him through.
splendour encompassed thee forth shone thy warrior might the rainobstructer lay in midairs lowest deep.
what time o indra thou didst cast thy thunder down upon the jaws of vṛitra hard to be restrained.
the hymns which magnify thee indra reach to thee even as waterbrooks flow down and fill the lake.
tvaṣṭar gave yet more force to thine appropriate strength and forged thy thunderbolt of overpowering might.
when indra thou whose power is linked with thy bay steeds hadst smitten vṛtra causing floods to flow for man.
thou heldst in thine arms the metal thunderbolt and settest in the heaven the sun for all to see.
in fear they raised the lofty selfresplendent hymn praise giving and effectual leading up to heaven.
when indras helpers fighting for the good of men the maruts faithful to mankind joyed in the light.
then heaven himself the mighty at that dragons roar reeled back in terror when indra thy thunderbolt.
in the wild joy of soma had struck off with might the head of vṛtra tyrant of the earth and heaven.
o indra were this earth extended forth tenfold and men who dwell therein multiplied day by day.
still here thy conquering might maghavan would be famed it hath waxed vast as heaven in majesty and power.
thou bold of heart in thine own native might for help upon the limit of this midair and of heaven.
hast made the earth to be the pattern of thy strength embracing flood and light thou reachest to the sky.
thou art the counterpart of earth the master of lofty heaven with all its mighty heroes.
thou hast filled all the region with thy greatness yea of a truth there is none other like thee.
whose amplitude the heaven and earth have not attained whose bounds the waters of midair have never reached.
not when in joy he fights the stayer of the rain thou and none else hast made all things in order due.
the maruts sang thy praise in this encounter and in thee all the deities delighted.
what time thou indra with thy spiky weapon thy deadly bolt smotest the face of vṛtra.
