with what bright beauty are the maruts jointly invested peers in age who dwell together.
from what place have they come with what intention sing they their strength through love of wealth these heroes.
whose prayers have they the youthful ones accepted who to his sacrifice hath turned the maruts.
we will delay them on their journey sweepingwith what high spiritthrough the air like eagles.
whence comest thou alone thou who art mighty indra lord of the brave what is thy purpose.
thou greetest us when meeting us the bright ones lord of bay steeds say what thou hast against us.
mine are devotions hymns sweet are libations strength stirs and hurled forth is my bolt of thunder.
they call for me their lauds are longing for me these my bay steeds bear me to these oblations.
therefore together with our strong companions having adorned our bodies now we harness.
our spotted deer with might for thou o indra hast learnt and understood our godlike nature.
where was that nature then of yours o maruts that ye charged me alone to slay the dragon.
for i in truth am fierce and strong and mighty i bent away from every foemans weapons.
yea much hast thou achieved with us for comrades with manly valour like thine own thou hero.
much may we too achieve o mightiest indra with our great power we maruts when we will it.
vṛtra i slew by mine own strength o maruts having waxed mighty in mine indignation.
i with the thunder in my hand created for man these lucid softly flowing waters.
nothing o maghavan stands firm before thee among the gods not one is found thine equal.
none born or springing into life comes nigh thee do what thou hast to do exceeding mighty.
mine only be transcendent power whatever i daring in my spirit may accomplish.
for i am known as terrible o maruts i indra am the lord of what i ruined.
now o ye maruts hath your praise rejoiced me the glorious hymn which ye have made me heroes.
for me for indra champion strong in battle for me yourselves as lovers for a lover.
here truly they send forth their sheen to meet me wearing their blameless glory and their vigour.
when i have seen you maruts in gay splendour ye have delighted me so now delight me.
who here hath magnified you o ye maruts speed forward o ye lovers to your lovers.
ye radiant ones assisting their devotions of these my holy rites he ye regardful.
to this hath mānyas wisdom brought us so as to aid as aids the poet him who worships.
bring hither quick on to the sage ye maruts these prayers for you the singer hath recited.
may this your praise may this your song o maruts sung by the poet mānas son māndārya.
bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
