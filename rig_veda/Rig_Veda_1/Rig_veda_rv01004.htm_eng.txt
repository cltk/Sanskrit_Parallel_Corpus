as a good cow to him who milks we call the doer of fair deeds.
to our assistance day by day.
come thou to our libations drink of soma somadrinker thou.
the rich ones rapture giveth kine.
so may we be acquainted with thine innermost benevolence.
neglect us not come hitherward.
go to the wise unconquered one ask thou of indra skilled in song.
him who is better than thy friends.
whether the men who mock us say depart unto another place.
ye who serve indra and none else.
or whether god of wondrous deeds all our true people call us blest.
still may we dwell in indras care.
unto the swift one bring the swift mancheering grace of sacrifice.
that to the friend gives wings and joy.
thou Śatakratu drankest this and wast the vṛtras slayer thou.
helpest the warrior in the fray.
we strengthen Śatakratu thee yea thee the powerful in fight.
that indra we may win us wealth.
to him the mighty stream of wealth prompt friend of him who pours the juice.
yea to this indra sing your song.
