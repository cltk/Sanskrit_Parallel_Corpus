winner of thousands kindled thou shinest a god with gods today.

child of thyself the sacrifice is for the righteous blent with meath.
presenting viands thousandfold.
invoked and worthy of our praise bring gods whose due is sacrifice.
thou agni givest countless gifts.
to seat a thousand heroes they eastward have strewn the grass with might.
whereon Ādityas ye shine forth.
the sovran allimperial doors wide good many and manifold.

let these two sages first of all heralds divine and eloquent.
