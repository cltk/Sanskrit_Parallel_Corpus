ye vasus twain ye rudras full of counsel grant us strong strengtheners when ye stand beside us.
what wealth aucathya craves of you great helpers when ye come forward with no niggard succour.
who may give you aught vasus for your favour for what at the cows place ye grant through worship.
wake for us understanding full of riches come with a heart that will fulfil our longing.
as erst for tugras son your car seacrossing strong was equipped and set amid the waters.
so may i gain your shelter and protection as with winged course a hero seeks his army.
may this my praise preserve ucathyas offspring let not these twain who fly with wings exhaust me.
let not the wood ten times uppiled consume me when fixed for you it bites the ground it stands on.
the most maternal streams wherein the d훮sas cast me securely bound have not devoured me.
when traitana would cleave my head asunder the d훮sa wounded his own breast and shoulders.
d카rghatamas the son of mamat훮 hath come to length of days in the tenth age of human kind.
he is the brahman of the waters as they strive to reach their end and aim their charioteer is he.
