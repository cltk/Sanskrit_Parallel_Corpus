o worthy of oblation lord of prospering powers assume thy robes.
and offer this our sacrifice.
sit ever to be chosen as our priest most youthful through our hymns.
o agni through our heavenly word.
for here a father for his son kinsman for kinsman worshippeth.
and friend choiceworthy for his friend.
here let the foedestroyers sit varuṇa mitra aryaman.
like men upon our sacred grass.
o ancient herald be thou glad in this our rite and fellowship.
hearken thou well to these our songs.
whateer in this perpetual course we sacrifice to god and god.
that gift is offered up in thee.
may he be our dear household lord priest pleasant and choiceworthy may.
we with bright fires be dear to him.
the gods adored with brilliant fires have granted precious wealth to us.
so with bright fires we pray to thee.
and o immortal one so may the eulogies of mortal men.
belong to us and thee alike.
with all thy fires o agni find pleasure in this our sacrifice.
and this our speech o son of strength.
