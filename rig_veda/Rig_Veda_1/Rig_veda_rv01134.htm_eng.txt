vĀyu let fleetfoot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast to drink first of the juice we pour to the first draught of soma juice.
may our glad hymn discerning well uplifted gratify thy mind.
come with thy teamdrawn car o vāyu to the gift come to the sacrificers gift.
may the joygiving drops o vāyu gladden thee effectual well prepared directed to the heavens strong blent with milk and seeking heaven.
that aids effectual to fulfil may wait upon our skilful power.
associate teams come hitherward to grant our prayers they shall address the hymns we sing.
two red steeds vāyu yokes vāyu two purple steeds swiftfooted to the chariot to the pole to draw most able at the pole to draw.
wake up intelligence as when a lover wakes his sleeping love.
illumine heaven and earth make thou the dawns to shine for glory make the dawns to shine.
for thee the radiant dawns in the fardistant sky broaden their lovely garments forth in wondrous beams brightcoloured in their newborn beams.
for thee the nectaryielding cow pours all rich treasures forth as milk.
the marut host hast thou engendered from the womb the maruts from the womb of heaven.
for thee the pure bright quicklyflowing somadrops strong in their heightening power hasten to mix themselves hasten to the water to be mixed.
to thee the weary coward prays for luck that he may speed away.
thou by thy law protectest us from every world yea from the world of highest gods.
thou vāyu who hast none before thee first of all hast right to drink these offerings of soma juice hast right to drink the juice outpoured.
yea poured by all invoking tribes who free themselves from taint of sin.
for thee all cows are milked to yield the somamilk to yield the butter and the milk.
