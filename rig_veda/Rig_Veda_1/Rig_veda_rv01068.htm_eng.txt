commingling restless he ascends the sky unveiling nights and all that stands or moves.
as he the sole god is preeminent in greatness among all these other gods.
all men are joyful in thy power o god that living from the dry wood thou art born.
all truly share thy godhead while they keep in their accustomed ways eternal law.
strong is the thought of law the laws behest all works have they performed he quickens all.
whoso will bring oblation gifts to thee to him bethinking thee vouchsafe thou wealth.
seated as priest with manus progeny of all these treasures he alone is lord.
men yearn for children to prolong their line and are not disappointed in their hope.
eagerly they who hear his word fulfil his wish as sons obey their sires behest.
he rich in food unbars his wealth like doors he the housefriend hath decked heavens vault with stars.
