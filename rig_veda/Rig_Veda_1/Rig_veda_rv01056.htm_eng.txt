for this mans full libations held in ladles he hath roused him eager as a horse to meet the mare.
he stays his golden car yoked with bay horses swift and drinks the soma juice which strengthens for great deeds.
to him the guidancefollowing songs of praise flow full as those who seek gain go in company to the flood.
to him the lord of power the holy synods might as to a hill with speed ascend the loving ones.
victorious great is he in manly battle shines unstained with dust his might as shines a mountain peak.
wherewith the iron one fierce een against the strong in rapture fettered wily Śushṇa fast in bonds.
when strength the goddess made more strong for help by thee waits upon indra as the sun attends the dawn.
then he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft with joy and triumphing.
when thou with might upon the framework of the heaven didst fix across airs region firmly unremoved.
in the lightwinning war indra in rapturous joy thou smotest vṛtra dead and broughtest floods of rain.
thou with thy might didst grasp the holderup of heaven thou who art mighty also in the seats of earth.
thou gladdened by the juice hast set the waters free and broken vṛtras stony fences through and through.
