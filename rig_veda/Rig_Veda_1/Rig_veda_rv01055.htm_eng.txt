though een this heavens wide space and earth have spread them out nor heaven nor earth may be in greatness indras match.
awful and very mighty causing woe to men he whets his thunderbolt for sharpness as a bull.
like as the watery ocean so doth he receive the rivers spread on all sides in their ample width.
he bears him like a bull to drink of soma juice and will as warrior from of old be praised for might.
thou swayest indra all kinds of great manly power so as to bend ast were even that famed mountain down.
foremost among the gods is he through hero might set in the van the strong one for each arduous deed.
he only in the wood is praised by worshippers when he shows forth to men his own fair indrapower.
a friendly bull is he a bull to be desired when maghavan auspiciously sends forth his voice.
yet verily the warrior in his vigorous strength stirreth up with his might great battles for mankind.
and men have faith in indra the resplendent one what time he hurleth down his bolt his dart of death.
though fain for glory and with strength increased on earth he with great might destroys the dwellings made with art.
he makes the lights of heaven shine forth secure he bids exceeding wise the floods flow for his worshipper.
drinker of soma let thy heart incline to give bring thy bays hitherward o thou who hearest praise.
those charioteers of thine best skilled to draw the rein the rapid sunbeams indra lead thee not astray.
thou bearest in both hands treasure that never fails the famed one in his body holds unvanquished might.
o indra in thy members many powers abide like wells surrounded by the ministering priests.
