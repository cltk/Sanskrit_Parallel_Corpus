even to him swift strong and high exalted i bring my song of praise as dainty viands.
my thought to him resistless praisedeserving prayers offered most especially to indra.
praise like oblation i present and utter aloud my song my fair hymn to the victor.
for indra who is lord of old the singers have decked their lauds with heart and mind and spirit.
to him then with my lips mine adoration winning heavens light most excellent i offer.
to magnify with songs of invocation and with fair hymns the lord most bounteous giver.
even for him i frame a laud as fashions the wright a chariot for the man who needs it.
praises to him who gladly hears our praises a hymn wellformed allmoving to wise indra.
so with my tongue i deck to please that indra my hymn as twere a horse through love of glory.
to reverence the hero bounteous giver famed far and wide destroyer of the castles.
even for him hath tvaṣṭar forged the thunder most deftly wrought celestial for the battle.
wherewith he reached the vital parts of vṛtra strikingthe vast the mighty with the striker.
as soon as at libations of his mother great viṣṇu had drunk up the draught he plundered.
the dainty cates the cooked mess but one stronger transfixed the wild boar shooting through the mountain.
to him to indra when he slew the dragon the dames too consorts of the gods wove praises.
the mighty heaven and earth hath he encompassed thy greatness heaven and earth combined exceed not.
yea of a truth his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of earth midair and heaven.
indra approved by all men selfresplendent waxed in his home loudvoiced and strong for battle.
through his own strength indra with bolt of thunder cut piecemeal vṛtra drier up of waters.
he let the floods go free like cows imprisoned for glory with a heart inclined to bounty.
the rivers played through his impetuous splendour since with his bolt he compassed them on all sides.
using his might and favouring him who worshipped he made a ford victorious for turvīti.
vast with thine ample power with eager movement against this vṛtra cast thy bolt of thunder.
rend thou his joints as of an ox dissevered with bolt oblique that floods of rain may follow.
sing with new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime the deeds of him yea him who moveth swiftly.
when hurling forth his weapons in the battle he with impetuous wrath lays low the foemen.
when he yea he comes forth the firm set mountains and the whole heaven and earth tremble for terror.
may nodhas ever praising the protection of that dear friend gain quickly strength heroic.
now unto him of these things hath been given what he who rules alone oer much electeth.
indra hath helped etaśa somapresser contending in the race of steeds with sūrya.
thus to thee indra yoker of bay coursers the gotamas have brought their prayers to please thee.
bestow upon them thought decked with all beauty may he enriched with prayer come soon and early.
