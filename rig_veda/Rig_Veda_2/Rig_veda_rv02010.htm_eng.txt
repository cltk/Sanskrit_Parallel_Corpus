agni first loudly calling like a father kindled by man upon the seat of worship.
clothed in his glory deathless keen of insight must be adorned by all the strong the famous.
may agni the resplendent hear my calling through all my songs immortal keen of insight.
dark steeds or ruddy draw his car or carried in sundry ways he makes them red of colour.
on wood supine they got the wellformed infant a germ in variousfashioned plants was agni.
and in the night not compassed round by darkness he dwells exceeding wise with rays of splendour.
with oil and sacred gifts i sprinkle agni who makes his home in front of all things living.
broad vast through vital power oÂ’er all expanded conspicuous strong with all the food that feeds him.
i pour to him who looks in all directions may he accept it with a friendly spirit.
agni with bridegrooms grace and lovely colour may not be touched when all his form is fury.

obtaining wealth i call on perfect agni who with an eloquent tongue dispenses sweetness.
