now praise as one who strives for strength the harnessing of agnis car.
the liberal the most splendid one.
who guiding worshippers aright withers untouched by age the foe.
when worshipped fair to look upon.
who for his glory is extolled at eve and morning in our homes.
whose statute is inviolate.
who shines refulgent like the sun with brilliance and with fiery flame.
decked with imperishable sheen.
him atri agni have our songs strengthened according to his sway.
all glories hath he made his own.
may we with agnis indras help with somas yea of all the gods.
uninjured dwell together still and conquer those who fight with us.
