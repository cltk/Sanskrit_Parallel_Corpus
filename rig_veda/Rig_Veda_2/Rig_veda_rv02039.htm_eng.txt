sing like the two pressstones for this same purpose come like two misers to the tree of treasure.
like two laudsinging brahmans in the assembly like the folks envoys called in many places.
moving at morning like two carborne heroes like to a pair of goats ye come electing.
like two fair dames embellishing their bodies like a wise married pair among the people.
like to a pair of horns come first to usward like to a pair of hoofs with rapid motion.
come like two cakavās in the grey of morning come like two chariot wheels at dawn ye mighty.
bear us across the rivers like two vessels save us as ye were yokes naves spokes and fellies.
be like two dogs that injure not our bodies preserve us like two crutches that we fall not.
like two winds ageing not two confluent rivers come with quick vision like two eyes before us.
come like two hands most helpful to the body and guide us like two feet to what is precious.
even as two lips that with the mouth speak honey even as two breasts that nourish our existence.
like the two nostrils that protect our being be to us as our ears that hear distinctly.
like two hands give ye us increasing vigour like heaven and earth constrain the airy regions.
aśvins these hymns that struggle to approach you sharpen ye like an axe upon a whetstone.
these prayers of ours exalting you o aśvins have the gṛtsamadas for a laud made ready.
welcome them o ye heroes and come hither loud may we speak with brave men in assembly.
