indu to us for this great rite bearing as twere thy wave to gods.
unwearied thou art flowing forqh.
pleased with the hymn impelled by prayer soma is hurried far away.
the wise one in the singers stream.
watchful among the gods this juice advances to the cleansing sieve.
soma most active travels on.
flow onward seeking strength for us embellishing the sacrifice.
the priest with trimmed grass calleth thee.
may soma ever bringing power to bhaga and to vāyu sage.
and hero lead us to the gods.
so to increase our wealth today inspirer best of furtherers.
win for us strength and high renown.
