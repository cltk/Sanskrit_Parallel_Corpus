to indra to the mighty steer may these goldcoloured juices go.
drops rapidly produced that find the light of heaven.
effused this juice victorious flows for indra for his maintenance.
soma bethinks him of the conqueror as he knows.
may indra in his raptures gain from him the grasp that gathers spoil.
and winning waters wield the steerstrong thunderbolt.
flow vigilant for indra thou soma yea indu run thou on.
bring hither splendid strength that finds the light of heaven.
do thou allbeautiful purify for indras sake the mighty juice.
pathmaker thou far seeing with a thousand ways.
best finder of prosperity for us most rich in sweets for gods.
proceed thou loudly roaring on a thousand paths.
o indu with thy streams in might flow for the banquet of the gods.
rich in meath soma in our beaker take thy place.
thy drops that swim in water have exalted indra to delight.
the gods have drunk thee up for immortality.
stream opulence to us ye drops of soma pressed and purified.
pouring down rain from heaven in hoods and finding light.
soma while filtered with his wave flows through the long wool of the sheep.
shouting while purified before the voice of song.
with songs they send the mighty forth sporting in wood above the fleece.
our psalms have glorified him of the triple height.
into the jars hath he been loosed like an impetuous steed for war.
and lifting up his voice while filtered glided on.
goldhued and lovely in his course througb tangles of the wool he flows.
and pours heroic fame upon the worshippers.
flow thus a faithful votary the streams of meath have been effused.
thou comest to the filter singing from each side.
