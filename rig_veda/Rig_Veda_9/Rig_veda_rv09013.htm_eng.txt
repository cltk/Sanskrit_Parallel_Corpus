passed through the fleece in thousand streams the soma purified flows on.
to indras viyus special place.
sing forth ye men who long for help to pavamana to the sage.
effused to entertain the gods.
the somadrops with thousand powers are purified for victory.
hymned to become the feast of gods.
yea as thou flowest bring great store of food that we may win the spoil.
indu bring splendid manly might.
may they in flowing give us wealth in thousands and heroic powerÂ—.
these godlike somadrops effused.
like coursers by their drivers urged they were poured forth for victory.
swift through the woollen strainingcloth.
noisily flow the somadrops like milchkine lowing to their calves.
they have run forth from both the hands.
as gladdener whom indra loves o pavamana with a roar.
drive all our enemies away.
o pavamamas driving off the godless looking on the light.
sit in the place of sacrifice.
