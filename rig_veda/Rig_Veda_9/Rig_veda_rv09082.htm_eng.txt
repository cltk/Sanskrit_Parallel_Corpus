even as a king hath soma red and tawny bull been pressed the wondrous one hath bellowed to the kine.
while purified he passes through the filtering fleece to seat him hawklike on the place that drops with oil.
to glory goest thou sage with disposing skill like a groomed steed thou rusbest forward to the prize.
o soma be thou gracious driving off distress thou goest clothed in butter to a robe of state.
parjanya is the father of the mighty bird on mountains in earths centre hath he made his home.
the waters too have flowed the sisters to the kine he meets the pressingstones at the beloved rite.
thou givest pleasure as a wife delights her lord listen o child of pajri for to thee i speak.
amid the holy songs go on that we may live in time of trouble soma watch thou free from blame.
as to the men of old thou camest indu unharmed to strengthen winning hundreds thousands.
so now for new felicity flow onward the waters follow as thy law ordaineth.
