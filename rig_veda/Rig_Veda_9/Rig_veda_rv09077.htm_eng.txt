more beauteous than the beautiful as indras bolt this soma rich in sweets hath clamoured in the vat.
dropping with oil abundant streams of sacrifice flow unto him like milchkine lowing with their milk.
on flows that ancient one whom hitherward from heaven sped through the region of the air the falcon snatched.
he quivering with alarm and terrified in heart before bowarmed kṛśānu holdeth fast the sweet.
may those first freshest drops of soma juice effused flow on their way to bring us mighty strength in kine.
beauteous as serpents worthy to be looked upon they whom each sacred gift and all our prayers have pleased.
may that muchlauded indu with a heart inclined to us wellknowing fight against our enemies.
he who hath brought the germ beside the strong ones seat moves onward to the widelyopcned stall of kine.
the active potent juice of heaven is flowing on great varuṇa whom the forward man can neer deceive.
mitra the holy hath been pressed for troubled times neighing like an impatient horse amid the herd.
