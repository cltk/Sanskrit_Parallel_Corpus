enkindled pavamana lord sends forth his light on every side.
in friendly show the bellowing bull.
he pavamana selfproduced speeds onward sharpening his horns.
he glitters through the firmament.
brilliant like wealth adorable with splendour pavamana shines.
mightily with the streams of meath.
the tawny pavamana who strews from of old the grass with might.
is worshipped god amid the gods.
the golden the celestial doors are lifted with their frames on high.
by pavamana glorified.
with passion pavamana longs for the great lofty pair wellformed.
like beauteous maidens night and dawn.
both gods who look on men i call celestial heralds indras self.
is pavamana yea the bull.
this pavamanas sacrifice shall the three beauteous goddesses.
sarasvatī and bhāratī and iḷā mighty one attend.
summon tvaṣṭar hither our protector champion earliestborn.
indu is indra tawny steer pavamana is prajāpati.
o pavamana with the meath in streams anoint vanaspati.
the evergreen the goldenhued refulgent with a thousand boughs.
come to the consecrating rite of pavamana all ye gods.
vāyu sūrya bṛhaspati indra and agni in accord.
