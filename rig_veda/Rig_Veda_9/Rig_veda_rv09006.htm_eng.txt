soma flow on with pleasant stream a bull devoted to the gods.
our friend unto the woollen sieve.
pour hitherward as indras self indu that gladdening stream of thine.
and send us coursers full of strength.
flow to the filter hitherward pouring that ancient gladdening juice.
streaming forth power and high renown.
hither the sparkling drops have flowed like waters down a steep descent.
they have reached indra purified.
whom having passed the filter ten dames cleanse as twere a vigorous steed.
while he disports him in the wood.
the steerstrong juice with milk pour forth for feast and service of the gods.
to him who bears away the draught.
effused the god flows onward with his stream to indra to the god.
so that his milk may strengthen him.
soul of the sacrifice the juice effused flows quickly on he keeps.
his ancient wisdom of a sage.
so pouring forth as indras friend strong drink best gladdener for the feast.
thou even in secret storest hymns.
