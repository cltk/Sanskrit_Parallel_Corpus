to soma who is purified as ordering priest the song is raised.
bring meed as twere to one who makes thee glad with hymns.
blended with milk and curds he flows on through the long wool of the sheep.
the goldhued purified makes him three seats for rest.
on through the long wool of the sheep to the meathdropping vat he flows.
the Ṛṣis sevenfold quire hath sung aloud to him.
shared by all gods infallible the leader of our holy hymns.
goldenhued soma being cleansed hath reached the bowls.
after thy godlike qualities associate with indra go.
as a priest purified by priests immortal one.
like a carhorse who shows his strength a god effused for deities.
the penetrating pavamana flows along.
