sit down o friends and sing aloud to him who purifies himself.
deck him for glory like a child with holy rites.
unite him bringing household wealth even as a calf with mother kine.
him who hath double strength the god delighting juice.
purify him who gives us power that he most blessed one may be.
a banquet for the troop mitra and varuá¹‡a.
voices have sung aloud to thee as finderout of wealth for us.
we clothe the hue thou wearest with a robe of milk.
thou indu art the food of gods o sovran of all gladdening drinks.
as friend for friend be thou best finder of success.
drive utterly away from us each demon each voracious fiend.
the godless and the false keep sorrow far away.
