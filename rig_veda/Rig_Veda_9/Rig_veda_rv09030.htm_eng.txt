streams of this potent one have flowed easily to the strainingcloth.
while he is cleansed he lifts his voice.
indu by pressers urged to speed bellowing out while beautified.
sends forth a very mighty sound.
pour on us soma with thy stream manconquering might which many crave.
accompanied with hero sons.
hither hath pavamana flowed soma flowed hither in a stream.
to settle in the vats of wood.
to waters with the stones they drive thee tawnyhued most rich in sweets.
o indu to be indras drink.
for indra for the thunderer press the soma very rich in sweets.
lovely inspiriting for strength.
