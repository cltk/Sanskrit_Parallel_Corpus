urged by the men this vigorous steed lord of the mind omniscient.
runs to the woollen strainingcloth.
within the filter hath he flowed this soma for the gods effused.
entering all their essences.
he shines in beauty there this god immortal in his dwellingplace.
foeslayer dearest to the gods.
directed by the sisters ten bellowing on his way this steer.
runs onward to the wooden vats.
this pavamana swiftand strong omniscient gave spleudour to.
the sun and all his forms of light.
this soma being purified flows mighty and infallible.
slayer of sinners dear togods.
