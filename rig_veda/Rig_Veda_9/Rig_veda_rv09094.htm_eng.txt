when beauties strive for him as for a charger then strive the songs like soldiers for the sunlight.
acting the sage he flows enrobed in waters and song as Â’twere a stall that kine may prosper.
the worlds expand to hirn who from aforetime found light to spread the law of life eternal.
the swelling songs like kine within the stable in deep devotion call aloud on indu.
when the sage bears his holy wisdom round him like a car visiting all worlds the hero.
becoming fame mid gods unto the mortal wealth to the skilled worth praise mid the everpresent.
for glory born be hath come forth to glory he giveth life and glory to the singers.
they clothed in glory have become immortal he measured in his course makes frays successful.
stream to us food and vigour kine and horses give us broad lights and fill thgods with rapture.
all ther are easy things for thee to master thou pavamana soma quellest foemen.
