the somadrops benevolent come forth as they are purified.
bestowing wealth which all may see.
o indu high oÂ’er heaven and earth be thou increaser of our might.
the master of all strength be thou.
the winds are gracious in their love to thee the rivers flow to thee.
soma they multiply thy power.
soma wax great from every side may vigorous powers unite in thee.
be in the gatheringplace of strength.
for thee brownhued the kine have poured imperishable oil and milk.
aloft on the sublimest height.
friendship o indu we desire with thee who bearest noble arms.
with thee o lord of all that is.
