after his ancient splendour they the bold have drawn the bright milk from.
the sage who wins a thousand gifts.
in aspect he is like the sun he runneth forward to the lakes.
seven currents flowing through the sky.
he shining in his splendour stands high over all things that exist.
soma a god as sÅ«rya is.
thou indu in thy brilliancy pourest on us as indras friend.
wealth from the kine to feast the gods.
