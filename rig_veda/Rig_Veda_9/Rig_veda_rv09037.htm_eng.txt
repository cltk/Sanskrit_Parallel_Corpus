soma the steer effused for draught flows to the purifying sieve.
slaying the fiends loving the gods.
farsighted tawnycoloured he flows to the sieve intelligent.
bellowing to his place of rest.
this vigorous pavamana runs forth to the luminous realm of heaven.
fiendslayer through the fleecy sieve.
this payamana up above tritas high ridge hath made the sun.
together with the sisters shine.
this vṛtraslaying steer effused soma roomgiver neer deceived.
hath gone as twere to win the spoil.
urged onward by the sage the god speeds forward to the casks of wood.
indu to indra willingly.
