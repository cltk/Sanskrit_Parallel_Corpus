o thou with stones for arms thy powers crushing the fiends have raised themselves.
chase thou the foes who compass us.
thou conquerest thus with might when car meets car and when the prize is staked.
with fearless heart will i sing praise.
no one with evil thought assails this pavamanas holy laws.
crush him who fain would fight with thee.
for indra to the streams they drive the tawny rapturedropping steed.
indu the bringer of delight.
