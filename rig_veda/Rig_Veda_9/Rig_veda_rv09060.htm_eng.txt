sing forth and laud with sacred song most active pavamana laud.
indu who sees with thousand eyes.
thee who hast thousand eyes to see bearer of thousand burthens they.
have filtered through the fleecy cloth.
he pavamana hath streamed through the fleece then he runs into the jars.
finding his way to indras heart.
that indra may be bounteous flow most active soma for our weal.
bring genial seed with progeny.
