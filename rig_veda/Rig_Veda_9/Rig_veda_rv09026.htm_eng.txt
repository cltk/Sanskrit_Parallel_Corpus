the sages with the fingers art have dressed and decked that vigorous steed.
upon the lap of aditi.
the kine have called aloud to him exhaustless with a thousand streams.
to indu who supporteth heaven.
him nourisher of many sage creative pavamana they.
have sent by wisdom to the sky.
him dweller with vivasvān they with use of both arms have sent forth.
the lord of speech infallible.
him green beloved many eyed the sisters with prosing stones.
send down to ridges of the sieve.
o pavamana indu priests hurry thee on to indra thee.
who aidest song and cheerest him.
