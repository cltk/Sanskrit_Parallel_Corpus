urged on the father of the earth and heaven hath gone forth like a car to gather booty.
going to indra sharpening his weapons and in his hand containing every treasure.
to him the tones of sacred song have sounded steer of the triple height the lifebestower.
dwelling in wood as varuṇa in rivers lavishing treasure he distributes blessings.
great conqueror warnorgirt lord of all heroes flow on thy way as he who winneth riches.
with sharpened arms with swift bow never vanquished in battle vanquishing in fight the foemen.
giving security lord of wide dominion send us both earth and heaven with all their fulness.
striving to win the dawns the light the waters and cattle call to us abundant vigour.
o soma gladden varuṇa and mitra cheer indu pavamana indra viṣṇu.
cheer thou the gods the company of maruts indu cheer mighty indra to rejoicing.
thus like a wise and potent king flow onward destroying with thy vigour all misfortunes.
for our wellspoken hymn give life o indu do ye preserve us evermore with blessings.
