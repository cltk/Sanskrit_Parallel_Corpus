obeying indras dear desire these soma juices have flowed forth.
increasing his heroic might.
laid in the bowl pureflowing on to vāyu and the aśvins may.
these give us great heroic strength.
soma as thou art purified incite to bounty indras heart.
to sit in place of sacrifice.
the ten swift fingers deck thee forth seven ministers impel thee on.
the sages have rejoiced in thee.
when through the filter thou art poured we clothe thee with a robe of milk.
to be a gladdening draught for gods.
when purified within the jars soma brightred and goldenhued.
hath clothed him with a robe of milk.
flow on to us and make us rich drive all our enemies away.
o indu flow into thy friend.
send down the rain from heaven a stream of opulence from earth give us.
o soma victory in war.
may we obtain thee indras drink who viewest men and findest light.
gain thee and progeny and food.
