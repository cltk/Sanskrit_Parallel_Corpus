flow thou who viewest men to give delight to entertain the gods.
indu to indra for his drink.
stream to thine embassy for us thou hastenest for indra to.
the gods o better than our friends.
we balm thee red of hue with milk to fit thee for the rapturous joy.
unbar for us the doors of wealth.
he through the sieve hath passed as comes a courser to the pole to run.
indu belongs unto the gods.
all friends have lauded him as he sports in the wood beyond the fleece.
singers have chanted indus praise.
flow indu with that stream wherein steeped thou announcest to the man.
who worships thee heroic strength.
