oerpowering vṛtras forward run to win great strength.
thou speedest to subdue like one exacting debts.
in thee effused o soma we rejoice ourselves for great supremacy in fight.
thou pavamana enterest into mighty deeds.
o pavamana thou didst generate the sun and spread the moisture out with power.
hasting to us with plenty vivified with milk.
thou didst produce him deathless god mid mortal men for maintenance of law and lovely amṛta.
thou evermore hast moved making strength flow to us.
all round about hast thou with glory pierced for us as twere a neverfailing well for men to drink.
borne on thy way in fragments from the pressers arms.
then beautifully radiant certain heavenly ones have sung to him their kinship as they looked thereon.
and savitar the god opens as twere a stall.
soma the men of old whose grass was trimmed addressed the hymn to thee for mighty strength and for renown.
so hero urge us onward to heroic power.
they have drained forth from out the great depth of the sky the old primeval milk of heaven that claims the laud.
they lifted up their voice to indra athis birth.
as long as thou o pavamana art above this earth and heaven and all existence in thy might.
thou standest like a bull the chief amid the herd.
in the sheeps wool hath soma pavamana flowed while they cleanse him like a playful infant.
indu with hundred powers and hundred currents.
holy and sweet while purified this indu flows on a wave of pleasant taste to indra.
strengthwinner treasurefinder life bestower.
so flow thou on subduing our assailants chasing the demons hard to beencountered.
wellarmed and conquering our foes o soma.
