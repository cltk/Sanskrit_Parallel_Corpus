the pressers from the somapress send forth thy juice for rapturous joy.
the speckled sap runs like a flood.
with strength we follow through the sieve him who brings might and wins the kine.
enrobed in water with his juice.
pour on the sieve the soma neer subdued in waters waterless.
and make it pure for indras drink.
moved by the purifiers thought the soma flows into the sieve.
by wisdom it hath gained its home.
with humble homage indra have the somadrops flowed forth to thee.
contending for the glorious prize.
purified in his fleecy garb attaining every beauty he.
stands herolike amid the kine.
swelling as twere to heights of heaven the stream of the creative juice.
falls lightly on the cleansing sieve.
thus soma purifying himwho knoweth song mid living men.
thou wanderest through the cloth of wool.
