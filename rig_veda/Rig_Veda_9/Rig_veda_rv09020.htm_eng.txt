forth through the strainingcloth the sage flows to the banquet of the gods.
subduing all our enemies.
for he as pavamana sends thousandfold treasure in the shape.
of cattle to the singingmen.
thou graspest all things with thy mind and purifiest thee with thoughts.
as such o soma find us fame.
pour lofty glory on us send sure riches to our liberal lords.
bring food to those who sing thy praise.
as thou art cleansed o wondrous steed o soma thou hast entered like.
a pious king into the songs.
he soma like a courser in the floods invincible made clean.
with hands is resting in the jars.
disporting like a liberal chief thou goest soma to the sieve.
lending the laud a heros strength.
