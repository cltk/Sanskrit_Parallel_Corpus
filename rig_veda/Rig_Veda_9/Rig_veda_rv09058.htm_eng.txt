swift runs this giver of delight even the stream of flowing juice.
swift runs this giver of delight.
the morning knows all precious things the goddess knows her grace to man.
swift runs this giver of delight.
we have accepted thousands from dhvasras and puruá¹£antis hands.
swift runs this giver of delight.
from whom we have accepted thus thousands and three times ten beside.
swift runs this giver of delight.
