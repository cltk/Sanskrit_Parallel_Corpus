the guerdon is bestowed the mighty takes his seat and everwatchful guards from fiend and evil sprite.
goldhued he makes the cloud his diadem the milk his carpet in both worlds and prayer his robe of state.
strong bellowing he goes like one who slays the folk he lets this hue of asuras flow off from him.
throws off his covering seeks his fathers meetingplace and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.
onward he flows from both the hands pressed out with stones excited by the prayer the water makes him wild.
he frolics and draws near completes his work with song and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.
they pour out meath around the master of the house celestial strengthener of the mountain that gives might.
in whom through his great powers oblationeating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.
they the ten sisters on the lap of aditi have sent him forward like a car from both the arms.
he wanders and comes near the cows mysterious place even the place which his inventions have produced.
like as a falcon to his home so speeds the god to his own golden wiselytashioned place to rest.
with song they urge the darling to the sacred grass the holy one goes like a courser to the gods.
from far away from heaven the redhued noted sage steer of the triple height hath sung unto the kine.
with thousand guidings he leading this way and that shines as a singer splendidly through many a morn.
his covering assumes a radiant hue whereer he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar.
the winner of the floods with food he seeks the host of heaven he comes to praises glorified with milk.
like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows he hath assumed the brilliancy of sūrya.
down to the earth hath looked the heavenly falcon soma with wisdom views all living creatures.
