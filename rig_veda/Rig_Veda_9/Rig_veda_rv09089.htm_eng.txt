this chariothorse hath moved along the pathways and pavamana flowed like rain from heaven.
with us hath soma with a thousand currents sunk in the wood upon his mothers bosom.
king he hath clothed him in the robe of rivers mounted the straightestgoing ship of order.
sped by the hawk the drop hath waxed in waters the father drains it drains the fathers offspring.
they come to him red tawny lord of heaven the watchful guardian of the meath the lion.
first hero in the fight he seeks the cattle and with his eye the steer is our protector.
they harness to the broadwheeled car the mighty courser whose back bears meath unwearied awful.
the twins the sisters brighten him and strengthenthese children of one damethe vigorous racer.
four pouring out the holy oil attend him sitting together in the same container.
to him they flow when purified with homage and still from every side are first about him.
he is the buttress of the heavens supporter of earth and in his hand are all the people.
be the teams lord a well to thee the singer cleansed is the sweet plants stalk for deed of glory.
fighting uninjured come where gods are feasted soma as vitraslayer flow for indra.
vouchsafe us ample riches very splendid may we be masters of heroic vigour.
