soma flow on inviting gods speed to the purifying cloth.
pass into indra as a bull.
as mighty food speed hitherward indu as a most splendid steer.
sit in thy place as one with strength.
the wellloved meath was made to flow the stream of the creative juice.
ne sage drew waters to himself.
the mighty waters yea the floods accompany thee mighty one.
when thou wilt clothe thee with the milk.
the lake is brightened in the floods soma our friend heavens prop and stay.
falls on the purifying cloth.
the tawny bull hath bellowed fair as mighty mitra to behold.
he shines together with the sun.
songs indu active in their might are beautified for thee wherewith.
thou deckest thee for our delight.
to thee who givest ample room we pray to win the joyous draught.
great are the praiseamp due to thee.
indu as indras friend on us pour with a stream of sweetness like.
parjanya sender of the rain.
winner of kine indu art thou winner of heroes steeds and strength.
primeval soul of sacrifice.
