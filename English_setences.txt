as one who ploughs with steers brings corn.
along their paths the mothers go sisters of priestly ministrants.
mingling their sweetness with the milk.
may waters gathered near the sun and those wherewith the sun is joined.
speed forth this sacrifice of ours.

wealth highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it which is laid.
free from all hatred in thy hands.
through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence.
which bhaga hath dealt out to us.
neer have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit.
nor these the waters that flow on for ever nor hills abaters of the winds wild fury.
varuṇa king of hallowed might sustaineth erect the trees stem in the baseless region.
its rays whose root is high above stream downward deep may they sink within us and be hidden.
king varuṇa hath made a spacious pathway a pathway for the sun wherein to travel.
where no way was he made him set his footstep and warned afar whateer afflicts the spirit.
a hundred balms are thine o king a thousand deep and widereaching also be thy favours.
far from us far away drive thou destruction put from us een the sin we have committed.
whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night set high in heaven above us.
varuṇas holy laws remain unweakened and through the night the moon moves on in splendor.
i ask this of thee with my prayer adoring thy worshipper craves this with his oblation.
varuṇa stay thou here and be not angry steal not our life from us o thou wideruler.
nightly and daily this one thing they tell me this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth.
may he to whom prayed fettered Śunaḥśepa may he the sovran varuṇa release us.
bound to three pillars captured Śunaḥśepa thus to the Āditya made his supplication.
him may the sovran varuṇa deliver wise neer deceived loosen the bonds that bind him.
with bending down oblations sacrifices o varuṇa we deprecate thine anger.
wise asura thou king of wide dominion loosen the bonds of sins by us committed.
loosen the bonds o varuṇa that hold me loosen the bonds above between and under.
so in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to aditi o thou Āditya.
whatever law of thine o god o varuṇa as we are men.
day after day we violate.
give us not as a prey to death to be destroyed by thee in wrath.
to thy fierce anger when displeased.
to gain thy mercy varuṇa with hymns we bind thy heart as binds.
the charioteer his tethered horse.
they flee from me dispirited bent only on obtaining wealth.
as to their nests the birds of air.
when shall we bring to be appeased the hero lord of warrior might.
him the farseeing varuṇa.
this this with joy they both accept in common never do they fail.
the everfaithful worshipper.
he knows the path of birds that fly through heaven and sovran of the sea.
he knows the ships that are thereon.
true to his holy law he knows the twelve moons with their progeny.
he knows the moon of later birth.
he knows the pathway of the wind the spreading high and mighty wind.
he knows the gods who dwell above.
varuṇa true to holy law sits down among his people he.
most wise sits there to govern all.
from thence a hreferratahtm.
1perceivinga he beholds all wondrous things both what hath been.
and what hereafter will be done.

varuṇa wearing golden mail hath clad him in a shining robe.
his spies are seated found about.
the god whom enemies threaten not nor those who tyrannize oer men.
nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.
he who gives glory to mankind not glory that is incomplete.
to our own bodies giving it.
yearning for the wideseeing one my thoughts move onward unto him.
as kine unto their pastures move.
once more together let us speak because my meath is brought priestlike.
thou eatest what is dear to thee.
now saw i him whom all may see i saw his car above the earth.
he hath accepted these my songs.

longing for help i cried to thee.

i will declare the manly deeds of indra the first that he achieved the thunderwielder.
he slew the dragon then disclosed the waters and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.
he slew the dragon lying on the mountain his heavenly bolt of thunder tvaṣṭar fashioned.
like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.
impetuous as a bull he chose the soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices.
maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.
when indra thou hadst slain the dragons firstborn and overcome the charms of the enchanters.
then giving life to sun and dawn and heaven thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.
indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces vṛtra worst of vṛtras.
as trunks of trees what time the axe hath felled them low on the earth so lies the prostrate dragon.
he like a mad weak warrior challenged indra the great impetuous manyslaying hero.
he brooking not the clashing of the weapons crushedindras foethe shattered forts in falling.
footless and handless still he challenged indra who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders.
emasculate yet claiming manly vigour thus vṛtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.
there as he lies like a bankbursting river the waters taking courage flow above him.
the dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which vṛtra with his greatness had encompassed.
then humbled was the strength of vṛtras mother indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her.
the mother was above the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay danu.
rolled in the midst of neverceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward.
the waters bear off vṛtras nameless body the foe of indra sank to during darkness.
guarded by ahi stood the thralls of dāsas the waters stayed like kine held by the robber.
but he when he had smitten vṛtra opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.
a horses tail wast thou when he o indra smote on thy bolt thou god without a second.
thou hast won back the kine hast won the soma thou hast let loose to flow the seven rivers.
nothing availed him lightning nothing thunder hailstorm or mist which had spread around him.
when indra and the dragon strove in battle maghavan gained the victory for ever.
whom sawest thou to avenge the dragon indra that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him.
that like a hawk affrighted through the regions thou crossedst nineandninety flowing rivers.
indra is king of all that moves and moves not of creatures tame and horned the thunderwielder.
over all living men he rules as sovran containing all as spokes within the felly.
come fain for booty let us seek to indra yet more shall he increase his care that guides us.
will not the indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this wealth of cattle.
i fly to him invisible wealthgiver as flies the falcon to his cherished eyrie.
with fairest hymns of praise adoring indra whom those who laud him must invoke in battle.
mid all his host he bindeth on the quiver he driveth cattle from what foe he pleaseth.
gathering up great store of riches indra be thou no trafficker with us most mighty.
thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy dasyu alone yet going with thy helpers indra.
far from the floor of heaven in all directions the ancient riteless ones fled to destruction.
fighting with pious worshippers the riteless turned and fled indra with averted faces.
when thou fierce lord of the bay steeds the stayer blewest from earth and heaven and sky the godless.
they met in fight the army of the blameless then the navagvas put forth all their power.
they like emasculates with men contending fled conscious by steep paths from indra scattered.
whether they weep or laugh thou hast oerthrown them o indra on the skys extremest limit.
the dasyu thou hast burned from heaven and welcomed the prayer of him who pours the juice and lauds thee.
adorned with their array of gold and jewels they oer the earth a covering veil extended.
although they hastened they oercame not indra their spies he compassed with the sun of morning.
as thou enjoyest heaven and earth o indra on every side surrounded with thy greatness.
so thou with priests hast blown away the dasyu and those who worship not with those who worship.
they who pervaded earths extremest limit subdued not with their charms the wealthbestower.
indra the bull made his ally the thunder and with its light milked cows from out the darkness.
the waters flowed according to their nature he raid the navigable streams waxed mighty.
then indra with his spirit concentrated smote him for ever with his strongest weapon.
indra broke through ilībiśas strong castles and Śuṣṇa with his horn he cut to pieces.
thou maghavan for all his might and swiftness slewest thy fighting foeman with thy thunder.
fierce on his enemies fell indras weapon with his sharp bull he rent their forts in pieces.
he with his thunderbolt dealt blows on vṛtra and conquered executing all his purpose.
indra thou helpest kutsa whom thou lovedst and guardedst brave daśadyu when he battled.
the dust of trampling horses rose to heaven and Śvitrās son stood up again for conquest.
Śvitrās mild steer o maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land mid tugras houses.
long stood they there before the task was ended thou wast the master of the foemens treasure.

and lead him safely oer distress.
