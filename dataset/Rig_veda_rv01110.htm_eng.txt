the holy work i wrought before is wrought again my sweetest hymn is sung to celebrate your praise.
here o ye Ṛbhus is this sea for all the gods sate you with soma offered with the hallowing word.
when seeking your enjoyment onward from afar ye certain of my kinsmen wandered on your way.
sons of sudhanvan after your long journeying ye came unto the home of liberal savitar.
savitar therefore gave you immortality because ye came proclaiming him whom naught can hide.
and this the drinkingchalice of the asura which till that time was one ye made to be fourfold.
when they had served with zeal at sacrifice as priests they mortal as they were gained immortality.
the Ṛbhus children of sudhanvan bright as suns were in a years course made associate with prayers.
the Ṛbhus with a rod measured as twere a field the single sacrificial chalice wide of mouth.
lauded of all who saw praying for what is best desiring glorious fame among immortal gods.
as oil in ladles we through knowledge will present unto the heroes of the firmament our hymn.
the Ṛbhus who came near with this great fathers speed and rose to heavens high sphere to eat the strengthening food.
Ṛbhu to us is indra freshest in his might Ṛbhu with powers and wealth is giver of rich gifts.
gods through your favour may we on the happy day quell the attacks of those who pour no offerings forth.
out of a skin o Ṛbhus once ye formed a cow and brought the mother close unto her calf again.
sons of sudhanvan heroes with surpassing skill ye made your aged parents youthful as before.
help us with strength where spoil is won o indra joined with the Ṛbhus give us varied bounty.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
