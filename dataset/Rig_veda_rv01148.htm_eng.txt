what mātariśvan piercing formed by friction herald of all the gods in varied figure.
is he whom they have set mid human houses gayhued as light and shining forth for beauty.
they shall not harm the man who brings thee praises such as i am agni my help approves me.
all acts of mine shall they accept with pleasure laudation from the singer who presents it.
him in his constant seat men skilled in worship have taken and with praises have established.
as harnessed to a chariot fleetfoot horses at his command let bearers lead him forward.
wondrous full many a thing he chews and crunches he shines amid the wood with spreading brightness.
upon his glowing flames the wind blows daily driving them like the keen shaft of an archer.
him whom while yet in embryo the hostile both skilled and fain to harm may never injure.
men blind and sightless through his splendour hurt not his neverfailing lovers have preserved him.
