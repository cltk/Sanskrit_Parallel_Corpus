he who gives food like patrimonial riches and guides aright like some wise mans instruction.
loved like a guest who lies in pleasant lodgingmay he as priest prosper his servants dwelling.
he who like savitar the god trueminded protecteth with his power all acts of vigour.
truthful like splendour glorified by many like breath joygivingall must strive to win him.
he who on earth dwells like a king surrounded by faithful friends like a god allsustaining.
like heroes who preside who sit in safety like as a blameless dame dear to her husband.
thee such in settlements secure o agni our men serve ever kindled in each dwelling.
on him have they laid splendour in abundance dear to all men bearer be he of riches.
may thy rich worshippers win food o agni and princes gain long life who bring oblation.
may we get booty from our foe in battle presenting to the gods their share for glory.
the cows of holy law sent us by heaven have swelled with laden udders loudly lowing.
soliciting his favour from a distance the rivers to the rock have flowed together.
agni with thee soliciting thy favour the holy ones have gained glory in heaven.
they made the night and dawn of different colours and set the black and purple hues together.
may we and those who worship be the mortals whom thou o agni leadest on to riches.
thou hast filled earth and heaven and airs midregion and followest the whole world like a shadow.
aided by thee o agni may we conquer steeds with steeds men with men heroes with heroes.
lords of the wealth transmitted by our fathers and may our princes live a hundred winters.
may these our hymns of praise agni ordainer be pleasant to thee in thy heart and spirit.
may we have power to hold thy steeds of riches laying on thee the godsent gift of glory.
