let us invoke you both this day and after the priest is here with lauds when morn is breaking.
nāsatyas wheresoeer ye be heavens children for him who is more liberal than the godless.
with us ye mighty let yourselves be joyful glad in our stream of soma slay the niggards.
graciously hear my hymns and invitations marking o heroes with your cars my longing.
nāsatyas pūṣans ye as gods for glory arranged and set in order sūryas bridal.
your giant steeds move on sprung from the waters like ancient times of varuṇa the mighty.
your grace be with us ye who love sweet juices further the hymn sung by the poet māna.
when men are joyful in your glorious actions to win heroic strength ye bounteous givers.
this praise was made o liberal lords o aśvins for you with fair adornment by the mānas.
come to our house for us and for our children rejoicing o nāsatyas in agastya.
we have passed oer the limit of this darkness our praise hath been bestowed on you o aśvins.
come hitherward by paths which gods have travelled may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
