now do i glorify their mighty cohort the company of these the youthful maruts.
who ride impetuous on with rapid horses and radiant in themselves are lords of amṛta.
the mighty glittering band armbound with bracelets givers of bliss unmeasured in their greatness.
with magical powers bountiful everroaringthese liberal heroes venerate thou singer.
this day may all your waterbringers maruts they who impel the falling rain approach us.
this fire o maruts hath been duly kindled let it find favour with you youthful sages.
ye raise up for the folk an active ruler whom holy ones a masters hand hath fashioned.
ye send the fighter hand to hand armmighty and the brave hero maruts with good horses.
they spring forth more and more strong in their glories like days like spokes where none are last in order.
highest and mightiest are the sons of pṛśni firm to their own intention cling the maruts.
when ye have hastened on with spotted coursers o maruts on your cars with strongwrought fellies.
the waters are disturbed the woods are shattered let dyaus the red steer send his thunder downward.
even earth hath spread herself wide at their coming and they as husbands have with power impregned her.
they to the pole have yoked the winds for coursers their sweat have they made rain these sons of rudra.
ho maruts heroes skilled in law immortal be gracious unto us ye rich in treasures.
ye hearers of the truth ye sage and youthful grown mighty dwelling on the lofty mountains.
