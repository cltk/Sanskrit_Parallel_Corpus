great power is in the beam of light sing praise to agni to the god.
whom men have set in foremost place like mitra with their eulogies.
he by the splendour of his arms is priest of every able man.
agni conveys oblation straight and deals as bhaga deals his boons.
all rests upon the laud and love of him the rich highflaming god.
on whom loudroaring men have laid great strength as on a faithful friend.
so agni be the friend of these with liberal gift of hero strength.
yea heaven and earth have not surpassed this youthful one in glorious fame.
o agni quickly come to us and glorified bring precious wealth.
so we and these our princes will assemble for the good of all be near in fight to prosper us.
