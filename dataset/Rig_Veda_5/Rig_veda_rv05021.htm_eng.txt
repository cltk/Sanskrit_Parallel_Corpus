we stablish thee as manus used as manus used we kindle thee.
like manus for the pious man  aá¹…giras agni worship gods.
for well o agni art thou pleased when thou art kindled mid mankind.
straight go the ladles unto thee thou highborn god whose food is oil.
thee have all gods of one accord established as their messenger.
serving at sacrifices men adore thee as a god o sage.
let mortal man adore your god agni with worship due to gods.
shine forth enkindled radiant one sit in the chamber of the law sit in the chamber of the food.
