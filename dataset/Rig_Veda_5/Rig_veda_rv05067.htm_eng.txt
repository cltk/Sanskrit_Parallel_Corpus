ye gods Ādityas varuṇa aryaman mitra verily.
have here obtained supremest sway high holy set apart for you.
when varuṇa and mitra ye sit in your golden dwellingplace.
ye twain supporters of mankind foeslayers give felicity.
all these possessors of all wealth varuṇa mitra aryaman.
follow their ways as if with feet and guard from injury mortal man.
for they are true they cleave to law held holy among every race.
good leaders bounteous in their gifts deliverers even from distress.
which of your persons varuṇa or mitra merits not our praise.
therefore our thought is turned to you the atris thought is turned to you.
