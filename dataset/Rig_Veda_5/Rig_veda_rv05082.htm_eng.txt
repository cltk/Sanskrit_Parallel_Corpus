we crave of savitar the god this treasure much to be enjoyed.
the best allyielding conquering gift of bhaga we would gladly win.
savitars own supremacy most glorious and beloved of all.
no one diminisheth in aught.
for savitar who is bhaga shall send riches to his worshipper.
that wondrous portion we implore.
send us this day god savitar prosperity with progeny.
drive thou the evil dream away.
savitar god send far away all sorrows and calamities.
and send us only what is good.
sinless in sight of aditi through the god savitars influence.
may we obtain all lovely things.
we with our hymns this day elect the general god lord of the good.
savitar whose decrees are true.
he who for ever vigilant precedes these twain the day and night.
is savitar the thoughtful god.
he who gives glory unto all these living creatures with the song.
and brings them forth is savitar.
