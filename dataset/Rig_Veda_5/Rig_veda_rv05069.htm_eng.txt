three spheres of light o varuṇa three heavens three firmaments ye comprehend o mitra.
waxed strong ye keep the splendour of dominion guarding the ordinance that lasts for ever.
ye varuṇa have kine who yield refreshment mitra your floods pour water full of sweetness.
there stand the three steers splendid in their brightness who fill the three worldbowls with genial moisture.
i call at dawn on aditi the goddess i call at noon and when the sun is setting.
i pray o mitravaruṇa for safety for wealth and progeny in rest and trouble.
ye who uphold the region sphere of brightness ye who support earths realm divine Ādityas.
the immortal gods o varuṇa and mitra never impair your everlasting statutes.
