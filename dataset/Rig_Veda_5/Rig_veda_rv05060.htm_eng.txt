i laud with reverence the gracious agni here may he sit and part our meed among us.
as with spoilseeking cars i bring oblation turned rightward i will swell the maruts praisesong.
the maruts yea the rudras who have mounted their famous spotted deer and cars swiftmoving.
before you fierce ones woods bow down in terror earth even the mountain trembles at your coming.
though vast and tall the mountain is affrighted the height of heaven is shaken at your roaring.
when armed with lances ye are sporting maruts and rush along together like the waters.
they like young suitors sons of wealthy houses have with their golden natures decked their bodies.
strong on their cars the lordly ones for glory have set their splendours on their forms for ever.
none being eldest none among them youngest as brothers they have grown to happy fortune.
may their sire rudra young and deft and pṛśni pouring much milk bring fair days to the maruts.
whether o blessed maruts ye be dwelling in highest midmost or in lowest heaven.
thence o ye rudras and thou also agni notice the sacrificial food we offer.
o maruts lords of all when agni and when ye drive downward from sublimest heaven along the heights.
shakers of all rejoicing slayers of the foe give riches to the somapressing worshipper.
o agni with the maruts as they gleam and sing gathered in troop rejoicing drink the soma juice.
with these the living ones who cleanse and further all joined with thy banner o vaiśvānara from of old.
