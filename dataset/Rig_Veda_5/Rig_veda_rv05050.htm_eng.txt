let every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding god.
each one solicits him for wealth and seeks renown to prosper him.
these leading god are thine and these here ready to speak after us.
as such may we attain to wealth and wait with services on thee.
so further honour as our guests the hero gods and then the dames.
may he remove and keep afar our foes and all who block our path.
where fire is set and swiftly runs the victim dwelling in the trough.
he wins with heroes in his home friendly to man like constant streams.
may these thy riches leader god that rule the car be blest to us.
yea blest to us for wealth and weal this will we ponder praising strength this ponder as we praise the god.
