full wise is he who hath discerned let him speak to us of the gods.
the man whose praisesongs varuṇa the beautiful or mitra loves.
for they are kings of noblest might of glorious fame most widely spread.
lords of the brave who strengthen law the holy ones with every race.
approaching you with prayer for aid together i address you first.
we who have good steeds call on you most sage to give us strength besides.
een out of misery mitra gives a way to dwelling at our case.
for he who worships hath the grace of mitra fighter in the van.
in mitras shelter that extends to utmost distance may we dwell.
unmenaced guarded by the care ever as sons of varuṇa.
ye mitra urge this people on and to one end direct their ways.
neglect not ye the wealthy chiefs neglect not us the Ṛṣis be our guardians when ye quaff the milk.
