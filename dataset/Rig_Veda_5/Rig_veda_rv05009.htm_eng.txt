bearing oblations mortal men o agni worship thee the god.
i deem thee jātavedas bear our offerings thou unceasingly.
in the mans home who offers gifts where grass is trimmed agni is priest.
to whom all sacrifices come and strengthenings that win renown.
whom as an infant newlyborn the kindlingsticks have brought to life.
sustainer of the tribes of men skilled in wellordered sacrifice.
yea very hard art thou to grasp like offspring of the wriggling snakes.
when thou consumest many woods like an ox agni in the mead.
whose flames when thou art sending forth the smoke completely reach the mark.
when tṛta in the height of heaven like as a smelter fanneth thee een as a smelter sharpeneth thee.
o agni by thy succour and by mitras friendly furtherance.
may we averting hate subdue the wickedness of mortal men.
o agni to our heroes bring such riches thou victorious god.
may he protect and nourish us and help in gaining strength be thou near us in fight for our success.
