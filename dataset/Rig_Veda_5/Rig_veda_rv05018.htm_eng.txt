at dawn let agni muchbeloved guest of the house be glorified.
immortal who delights in all oblations brought by mortal men.
for dvita who receives through wealth of native strength maimed offerings.
thy praiser even gains at once the somadrops immortal gods.
nobles with song i call that car of yours that shines with lengthened life.
for god who givest steeds that car hither and thither goes unharmed.
they who have varied ways of thought who guard the lauds within their lips.
and strew the grass before the light have decked themselves with high renown.
immortal agni give the chiefs heroes who institute the rite.
heroesÂ’ illustrious lofty fame who at the synod met for praise presented me with fifty steeds.
