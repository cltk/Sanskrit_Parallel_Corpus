god may a mortal call the strong hither with solemn rites to aid.
a man call agni to protect when sacrifice is well prepared.
near him thou seemest mightier still in native glory set to hold.
apart yon flamehued vault of heaven lovely beyond the thought of man.
yea this is by the light of him whom powerful song hath bound to act.
whose beams of splendour flash on high as though they sprang from heavenly seed.
wealth loads the wonderworkers car through his the very wise ones power.
then meet to be invoked among all tribes is agni glorified.
now too the princes shall obtain excellent riches by our lips.
protect us for our welfare lend thy succour o thou son of strength be near in fight to prosper us.
