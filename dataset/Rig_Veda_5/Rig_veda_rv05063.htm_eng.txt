guardians of order ye whose laws are ever true in the sublimest heaven your chariot ye ascend.
o mitravaruṇa whomsoeer ye favour here to him the rain with sweetness streameth down from heaven.
this worlds imperial kings o mitravaruṇa ye rule in holy synod looking on the light.
we pray for rain your boon and immortality through heaven and over earth the thunderers take their way.
imperial kings strong heroes lords of earth and heaven mitra and varuṇa ye ever active ones.
ye wait on thunder with the manytinted clouds and by the asuras magic power cause heaven to rain.
your magic mitravaruṇa resteth in the heaven the sun the wondrous weapon cometh forth as light.
ye hide him in the sky with cloud and flood of rain and waterdrops parjanya full of sweetness flow.
the maruts yoke their easy car for victory o mitravaruṇa as a hero in the wars.
the thunderers roam through regions varied in their hues imperial kings bedew us with the milk of heaven.
refreshing is your voice o mitravaruṇa parjanya sendeth out a wondrous mighty voice.
with magic power the maruts clothe them with the clouds ye two cause heaven to rain the red the spotless one.
wise with your law and through the asuras magic power ye guard the ordinances mitravaruṇa.
ye by eternal order govern all the world ye set the sun in heaven as a refulgent car.
