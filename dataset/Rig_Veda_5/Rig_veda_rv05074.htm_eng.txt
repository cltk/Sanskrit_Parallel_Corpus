where in the heavens are ye today gods aśvins rich in constancy.
hear this ye excellent as steers atri inviteth you to come.
where are they now where are the twain the famed nāsatyas gods in heaven.
who is the man ye strive to reach who of your suppliants is with you.
whom do ye visit whom approach to whom direct your harnessed car.
with whose devotions are ye pleased we long for you to further us.
ye strengtheners for paura stir the filler swimming in the flood.
advancing to be captured like a lion to the ambuscade.
ye from cyavana worn with age removed his skin as twere a robe.
so when ye made him young again he stirred the longing of a dame.
here is the man who lauds you both to see your glory are we here.
now bear me come with saving help ye who are rich in store of wealth.
who among many mortal men this day hath won you to himself.
what bard accepters of the bard who rich in wealth with sacrifice.
o aśvins may your car approach most excellent of cars for speed.
through many regions may our praise pass onward among mortal men.
may our laudation of you twain lovers of meath be sweet to you.
fly hitherward ye wise of heart like falcons with your winged steeds.
o aśvins when at any time ye listen to this call of mine.
for you is dainty food prepared they mix refreshing food for you.
