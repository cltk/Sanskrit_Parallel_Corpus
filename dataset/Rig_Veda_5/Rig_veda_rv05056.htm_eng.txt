agni that valorous company adorned with ornaments of gold.
the people of the maruts i call down today even from the luminous realm of heaven.
even as thou thinkest in thy heart thither my wishes also tend.
those who have come most near to thine invoking calls strengthen them fearful to behold.
earth like a bounteous lady liberal of her gifts struck down and shaken yet exultant comes to us.
impetuous as a bear o maruts is youi rush terrible as a dreadful bull.
they who with mighty strength oerthrow like oxen difficult to yoke.
cause een the heavenly stone to shake  yea shake the rocky mountain as they race along.
rise up even now with lauds i call the very numerous company.
unequalled of these maruts like a herd of kine grown up together in their strength.
bind to your car the bright red mares yoke the red coursers to your car.
bind to the pole to draw the fleetfoot tawny steeds the best at drawing to the pole.
yea and this loudlyneighing bright red vigorous horse who hath been sutioned fair to see.
let him not cause delay o maruts in your course urge ye him onward in your cars.
the maruts chariot ever fain to gather glory we invoke.
which rodasī hath mounted bringing pleasant gifts with maruts in her company.
i call that brilliant band of yours adorable rapid on the car.
whereon the bounteous dame auspicious nobly born shows glorious with the marut host.
