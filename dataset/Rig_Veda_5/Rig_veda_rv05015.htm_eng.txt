to him the farrenowned the wise ordainer ancient and glorious a song i offer.
enthroned in oil the asura blissgiver is agni firm support of noble riches.
by holy law they kept supporting order by help of sacrifice in loftiest heaven.
they who attained with born men to the unborn men seated on that stay heavens firm sustainer.
averting woe they labour hard to bring him the ancient plenteous food as power resistless.
may he born newly conquer his assailants round him they stand as round an angry lion.
when like a mother spreading forth to nourish to cherish and regard each man that liveth.
consuming all the strength that thou hast gotten thou wanderest round thyself in varied fashion.
may strength preserve the compass of thy vigour god that broad stream of thine that beareth riches.
thou like a thief who keeps his refuge secret hast holpen atri to great wealth by teaching.
