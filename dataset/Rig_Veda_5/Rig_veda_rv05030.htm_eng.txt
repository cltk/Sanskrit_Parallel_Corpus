where is that hero who hath looked on indra borne on lightrolling car by tawny coursers.
who thunderer seeks with wealth the somapresser and to his house goes muchinvoked to aid him.
i have beheld his strong and secret dwelling longing have sought the founders habitation.
i asked of others and they said in answer may we awakened men attain to indra.
we will tell indra when we pour libation what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us.
let him who knows not learn who knows them listen hither rides maghavan with all his army.
indra when born thou madest firm thy spirit alone thou seekest war to fight with many.
with might thou clavest een the rock asunder and foundest out the stable of the milchkine.
when thou wast born supremest at a distance bearing a name renowned in faroff regions.
since then een gods have been afraid of indra he conquered all the floods which served the dāsa.
these blissful maruts sing their psalm to praise thee and pour to thee libation of the soma.
indra with wondrous powers subdued the dragon the guileful lurker who beset the waters.
thou maghavan from the first didst scatter foemen speeding while joying in the milk the giver.
there seeking mans prosperity thou torest away the head of namuci the dāsa.
pounding the head of namuci the dāsa me too thou madest thine associate indra.
yea and the rolling stone that is in heaven both worlds as on a car brought to the maruts.
women for weapons hath the dāsa taken what injury can his feeble armies to me.
well he distinguished his two different voices and indra then advanced to fight the dasyu.
divided from their calves the cows went lowing around on every side hither and thither.
these indra reunited with his helpers what time the wellpressed soma made him joyful.
what time the somas mixed by babhru cheered him loud the steer bellowed in his habitations.
so indra drank thereof the fortdestroyer and gave him guerdon in return of milchkine.
this good deed have the rusamas done agni that they have granted me four thousand cattle.
we have received rnancayas wealth of heroes the most heroic which was freely offered.
the rusamas o agni sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands.
the strong libations have made indra joyful when night whose course was ending changed to morning.
night wellnigh ended at rnancayas coming king of the rusamas was changed to morning.
like a strong courser fleet of foot urged onward babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon.
we have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the rusamas o agni.
and we the singers have received the caldron of metal which was heated for pravargya.
