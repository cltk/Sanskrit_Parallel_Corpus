you foemanslaying varuṇa and mitra we invoke with song.
who as with penfold of your arms encompass round the realm of light.
stretch out your arms with favouring love unto this man who singeth hymns.
for in all places is sung forth your evergracious friendliness.
that i may gain a refuge now may my steps be on mitras path.
men go protected in the charge of this dear friend who harms us not.
mitra and varuṇa from you may i by song win noblest meed.
that shall stir envy in the homes of wealthy chiefs and those who praise.
with your fair splendours varuṇa and mitra to our gathering come.
that in their homes the wealthy chiefs and they who are your friends may thrive.
with those moreover among whom ye hold your high supremacy.
vouchsafe us room that we may win strength for prosperity and wealth.
when morning flushes holy ones in the gods realm where white cows shine.
supporting arcananas speed ye heroes with your active feet hither to my pressed soma juice.
