one state begets another state husk is made visible from husk.
within his mothers side he speaks.
discerning have they offered gifts they guard the strength that never wastes.
to a strong fort have they pressed in.
Śvaitreyas people all his men have gloriously increased in might.
a gold chain bṛhaduktha wears as through this soma seeking spoil.
i bring as twere the longedfor milk the dear milk of the sisterpair.
like to a caldron filled with food is he unconquered conquering all.
beam of light come to us in sportive fashion finding thyself close to the wind that fans thee.
these flames of his are wasting flames like arrows keenpointed sharpened on his breast.
