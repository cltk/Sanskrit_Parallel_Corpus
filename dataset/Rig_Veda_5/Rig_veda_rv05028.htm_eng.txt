agni inflamed hath sent to heaven his lustre he shines forth widely turning unto morning.
eastward the ladle goes that brings all blessing praising the godswith homage and oblation.
enkindled thou art king of the immortal world him who brings offerings thou attendest for his weal.
he whom thou urgest on makes all possessions his he sets before thee agni gifts that guests may claim.
show thyself strong for mighty bliss o agni most excellent be thine effulgent splendours.
make easy to maintain our household lordship and overcome the might of those who hate us.
thy glory agni i adore kindled exalted in thy strength.
a steer of brilliant splendour thou art lighted well at sacred rites.
agni invoked and kindled serve the gods thou skilled in sacrifice.
for thou art bearer of our gifts.
invoke and worship agni while the sacrificial rite proceeds.
for offeringbearer choose ye him.
