well knowing i have bound me horselike to the pole i carry that which bears as on and gives us help.
i seek for no release no turning back therefrom may he who knows the way the leader guide me straight.
o agni indra varuṇa and mitra give o ye gods and marut host and viṣṇu.
may both nāsatyas rudra heavenly matrons pūṣan sarasvatī bhaga accept us.
indra and agni mitra varuṇa aditi the waters mountains maruts sky and earth and heaven.
viṣṇu i call pūṣan and brahmaṇaspati and bhaga samsa savitar that they may help.
may viṣṇu also and vāta who injures none and soma granter of possessions give us joy.
and may the Ṛbhus and the aśvins tvaṣṭar and vibhvan remember us so that we may have wealth.
so may the band of maruts dwelling in the sky the holy come to us to sit on sacred grass.
bṛhaspati and pūṣan grant us sure defence varuṇa mitra aryaman guard and shelter us.
and may the mountains famed in noble eulogies and the fairgleaming rivers keep us safe from harm.
may bhaga the dispenser come with power and grace and farpervading aditi listen to my call.
may the gods spouses aid us of their own freewill aid us to offspring and the winning of the spoil.
grant us protection o ye gracious goddesses ye who are on the earth or in the waters realm.
may the dames wives of gods enjoy our presents rat aśvini agnāyī and indrāṇī.
may rodasī and varuṇānī hear us and goddesses come at the matrons season.
