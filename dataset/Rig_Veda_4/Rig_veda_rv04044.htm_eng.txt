we will invoke this day your car farspreading o aśvins even the gathering of the sunlight.
car praised in hymns most ample rich in treasure fitted with seats the car that beareth sūrya.
aśvins ye gained that glory by your godhead ye sons of heaven by your own might and power.
food followeth close upon your bright appearing when stately horses in your chariot draw you.
who bringeth you today for help with offered oblation or with hymns to drink the juices.
who for the sacrifices ancient lover turneth you hither aśvins offering homage.
borne on your golden car ye omnipresent come to this sacrifice of ours nāsatyas.
drink of the pleasant liquor of the soma give riches to the people who adore you.
come hitherward to us from earth from heaven borne on your golden chariot rolling lightly.
suffer not other worshippers to stay you here are ye bound by earlier bonds of friendship.
now for us both mete out o wonderworkers riches exceeding great with store of heroes.
because the men have sent you praise o aśvins and ajamīlhas come to the laudation.
wheneer i gratified you here together your grace was given us o ye rich in booty.
protect ye twain the singer of your praises to you nāsatyas is my wish directed.
