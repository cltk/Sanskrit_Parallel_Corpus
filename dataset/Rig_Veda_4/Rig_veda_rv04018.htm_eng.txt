this is the ancient and accepted pathway by which all gods have come into existence.
hereby could one be born though waxen mighty let him not otherwise destroy his mother.
not this way go i forth hard is the passage forth from the side obliquely will i issue.
much that is yet undone must i accomplish one must i combat and the other question.
he bent his eye upon the dying mother my word i now withdraw that way i follow.
in tvaṣṭars dwelling india drank the soma a hundredworth of juice pressed from the mortar.
what strange act shall he do he whom his mother bore for a thousand months and many autumns.
no peer hath he among those born already nor among those who shall be born hereafter.
deeming him a reproach his mother hid him indra endowed with all heroic valour.
then up he sprang himself assumed his vesture and filled as soon as born the earth and heaven.
with lively motion onward flow these waters the holy ones shouting as twere together.
ask them to tell thee what the floods are saying what girdling rock the waters burst asunder.
are they addressing him with words of welcome will the floods take on them the shame of indra.
with his great thunderbolt my son hath slaughtered vṛtra and set these rivers free to wander.
i cast thee from me minethy youthful mother thee mine own offspring kusava hath swallowed.
to him mine infant were the waters gracious indra my son rose up in conquering vigour.
thou art mine own o maghavan whom vyaṁsa struck to the ground and smote thy jaws in pieces.
but smitten through the mastery thou wonnest and with thy bolt the dāsas head thou crushedst.
the heifer hath brought forth the strong the mighty the unconquerable bull the furious indra.
the mother left her unlicked calf to wander seeking himself the path that he would follow.
then to her mighty child the mother turned her saying my son these deities forsake thee.
then indra said about to slaughter vṛtra o my friend vṛtra stride full boldly forward.
who was he then who made thy mother widow who sought to stay thee lying still or moving.
what god when by the foot thy sire thou tookest and slewest was at hand to give thee comfort.
in deep distress i cooked a dogs intestines among the gods i found not one to comfort.
my consort i beheld in degradation the falcon then brought me the pleasant soma.
