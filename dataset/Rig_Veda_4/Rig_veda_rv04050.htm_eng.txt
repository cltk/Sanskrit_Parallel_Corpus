him who with might hath propped earths ends who sitteth in threefold seat bṛhaspati with thunder.
him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages deepthinking holy singers set before them.
wild in their course in wellmarked wise rejoicing were they bṛhaspati who pressed around us.
preserve bṛhaspati the stall uninjured this companys raining evermoving birthplace.
bṛhaspati from thy remotest distance have they sat down who love the law eternal.
for thee were dug wells springing from the mountain which murmuring round about pour streams of sweetness.
bṛhaspati when first he had his being from mighty splendour in supremest heaven.
strong with his sevenfold mouth with noise of thunder with his seven rays blew and dispersed the darkness.
with the loudshouting band who sang his praises with thunder he destroyed obstructive vala.
bṛhaspati thundering drave forth the cattle the lowing cows who make oblations ready.
serve we with sacrifices gifts and homage even thus the steer of all the gods the father.
bṛhaspati may we be lords of riches with noble progeny and store of heroes.
surely that king by power and might heroic hath made him lord of all his foes possesions.
who cherishes bṛhaspati welltended adorns and worships him as foremost sharer.
in his own house he dwells in peace and comfort to him for ever holy food flows richly.
to him the people with free will pay homagethe king with whom the brahman hath precedence.
he unopposed is master of the riches of his own subjects and of hostile people.
the gods uphold that king with their protection who helps the brahman when he seeks his favour.
indra bṛhaspati rainers of treasure rejoicing at this sacrifice drink the soma.
let the abundant drops sink deep within you vouchsafe us riches with full store of heroes.
bṛhaspati and indra make us prosper may this be your benevolence to usward.
assist our holy thoughts wake up our spirit weaken the hatred of our foe and rivals.
