may indra come to us for our protection here be the hero praised our feastcompanion.

hither let indra come from earth or heaven hither with speech from firmament or ocean.
with maruts from the realm of light to aid us or from a distance from the seat of order.
that indra will we laud in our assemblies him who is lord of great and lasting riches.
victor with vāyu where the herds are gathered who leads with boldness on to higher fortune.
