from you two came the gifts in days aforetime which trasadasyu granted to the pūrus.
ye gave the winner of our fields and ploughlands and the strong smiter who subdued the dasyus.
and ye gave mighty dadhikrās the giver of many gifts who visiteth all people.
impetuous hawk swift and of varied colour like a brave king whom each true man must honour.
whom as twere down a precipice swift rushing each pūru praises and his heart rejoices.
springing forth like a hero fain for battle whirling the car and flying like the tempest.
who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth winning spoil among the cattle.
shown in bright colour looking on the assemblies beyond the churl to worship of the living.
loudly the folk cry after him in battles as twere a thief who steals away a garment.
speeding to glory or a herd of cattle even as a hungry falcon swooping downward.
and fain to come forth first amid these armies this way and that with rows of cars he rushes.
gay like a bridesman making him a garland tossing the dust champing the rein that holds him.
and that strong steed victorious and faithful obedient with his body in the combat.
speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing casts oer his brows the dust he tosses upward.
and at his thunder like the roar of heaven those who attack tremble and are affrighted.
for when he fights against embattled thousands dread is he in his striving none may stay him.
the people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet steed who giveth men abundance.
of him they say when drawing back from battle dadhikrās hath sped forward with his thousands.
dadhikrās hath oerspread the fivefold people with vigour as the sun lightens the waters.
may the strong steed who winneth hundreds thousands requite with sweetness these my words and praises.
