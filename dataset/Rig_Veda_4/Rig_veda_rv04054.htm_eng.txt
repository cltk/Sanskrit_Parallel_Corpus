now must we praise and honour savitar the god at this time of the day the men must call to him.
him who distributes wealth to manus progeny that he may grant us here riches most excellent.
for thou at first producest for the holy gods the noblest of all portions immortality.
thereafter as a gift to men o savitar thou openest existence life succeeding life.
if we men as we are have sinned against the gods through want of thought in weakness or through insolence.
absolve us from the guilt and make us free from sin o savitar alike among both gods and men.
none may impede that power of savitar the god whereby he will maintain the universal world.
what the fairfingered god brings forth on earths expanse or in the height of heaven that work of his stands sure.
to lofty hills thou sendest those whom indra leads and givest fixed abodes with houses unto these.
however they may fly and draw themselves apart still savitar they stand obeying thy behest.
may the libations poured to thee thrice daily day after day o savitar bring us blessing.
may indra heaven earth sindhu with the waters aditi with Ä€dityas give us shelter.
