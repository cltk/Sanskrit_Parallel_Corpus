i was aforetime manu i was sūrya i am the sage kakṣīvān holy singer.
kutsa the son of Ārjuni i master i am the sapient uśanā behold me.
i have bestowed the earth upon the Ārya and rain upon the man who brings oblation.
i guided forth the loudlyroaring waters and the gods moved according to my pleasure.
in the wild joy of soma i demolished Śambaras forts ninetyandnine together.
and utterly the hundredth habitation when helping divodāsa atithigva.
before all birds be ranked this bird o maruts supreme of falcons be this fleetwinged falcon.
because strong pinioned with no car to bear him he brought to manu the godloved oblation.
when the bird brought it hence in rapid motion sent on the wide path fleet as thought he hurried.
swift he returned with sweetness of the soma and hence the falcon hath acquired his glory.
bearing the stalk the falcon speeding onward bird bringing from afar the draught that gladdens.
friend of the gods brought grasping fast the soma which be bad taken from yon loftiest heaven.
the falcon took and brought the soma bearing thousand libations with him yea ten thousand.
the bold one left malignities behind him wise in wild joy of soma left the foolish.
