allied with thee in this thy friendship soma indra for man made waters flow together.
slew ahi and sent forth the seven rivers and opened as it were obstructed fountains.
indu with thee for his confederate indra swiftly with might pressed down the wheel of sūrya.
what rolled all lifes support on heavens high summit was separated from the great oppressor.
indra smote down agni consumed o indu the dasyus ere the noontide in the conflict.
of those who gladly sought a hardwon dwelling he cast down many a thousand with his arrow.
lower than all besides hast thou o indra cast down the dasyus abject tribes of dāsas.
ye drave away ye put to death the foemen and took great vengeance with your murdering weapons.
so of a truth indra and soma heroes ye burst the stable of the kine and horses.
the stable which the bar or stone obstructed and piercing through set free the habitations.
