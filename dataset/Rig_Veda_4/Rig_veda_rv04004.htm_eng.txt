put forth like a widespreading net thy vigour go like a mighty king with his attendants.
thou following thy swift net shootest arrows transfix the fiends with darts that burn most fiercely.
forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons follow them closely glowing in thy fury.
spread with thy tongue the winged flames o agni unfettered cast thy firebrands all around thee.
send thy spies forward fleetest in thy motion be neer deceived the guardian of this people.
from him who near or far is bent on evil and let no trouble sent from thee oercome us.
rise up o agni spread thee out before us burn down our foes thou who hast sharpened arrows.
him blazing agni who hath worked us mischief consume thou utterly like driedup stubble.
rise agni drive off those who fight against us make manifest thine own celestial vigour.
slacken the strong bows of the demondriven destroy our foemen whether kin or stranger.
most youthful god he knoweth well thy favour who gave an impulse to this high devotion.
all fair days and magnificence of riches hast thou beamed forth upon the good mans portals.
blest agni be the man the liberal giver who with his lauds and regular oblation.
is fain to please thee for his life and dwelling may all his days be bright be this his longing.
i praise thy gracious favour sing in answer may this my song sing like a loved one with thee.
lords of good steeds and cars may we adorn thee and day by day vouchsafe thou us dominion.
here of free choice let each one serve thee richly resplendent day by day at eve and morning.
so may we honour thee content and joyous passing beyond the glories of the people.
whoso with good steeds and fine gold o agni comes nigh thee on a car laden with treasure.
his friend art thou yea thou art his protector whose joy it is to entertain thee duly.
through words and kinship i destroy the mighty this power i have from gotama my father.
mark thou this speech of ours o thou most youthful friend of the house exceeding wise invoker.
knowing no slumber speedy and propitious alert and ever friendly most unwearied.
may thy protecting powers unerring agni taking their places here combined preserve us.
thy guardian rays o agni when they saw him preserved blind māmateya from affliction.
lord of all riches he preserved the pious the fees who fain would harm them did no mischief.
aided by thee with thee may we be wealthy may we gain strength with thee to guide us onward.
fulfil the words of both o ever truthful straightway do this thou god whom power emboldens.
o agni with this fuel will we serve thee accept the laud we sing to thee with favour.
destroy the cursing rākṣasas preserve us o rich in friends from guile and scorn and slander.
