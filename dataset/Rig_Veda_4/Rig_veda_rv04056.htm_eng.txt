may mighty heaven and earth most meet for honour be present here with light and gleaming splendours.
when fixing them apart vast most extensive the steer roars loudly in farreaching courses.
the goddesses with gods holy with holy the two stand pouring out their rain exhaustless.
faithful and guileless having gods for children leaders of sacrifice with shining splendours.
sure in the worlds he was a skilful craftsman he who produced these twain the earth and heaven.
wise with his power he brought both realms together spacious and deep wellfashioned unsupported.
o heaven and earth with one accord promoting with high protection as of queens our welfare.
farreaching universal holy guard us may we carborne through song be victors ever.
to both of you o heaven and earth we bring our lofty song of praise.
pure ones to glorify you both.
ye sanctify each others form by your own proper might ye rule.
and from of old observe the law.
furthering and fulfilling ye o mighty perfect mitras law.
ye sit around our sacrifice.
