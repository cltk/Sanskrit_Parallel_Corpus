here by ordainers was this god appointed first invoker best at worship to be praised at rites.

when shall thy glory as a god agni be suddenly shown forth.
for mortal men have held thee fast adorable in all their homes.
seeing thee faithful to the law most sapient like the starry heaven.
illumining with cheerful ray each solemn rite in every house.
vivasvāns envoy living men have taken as their ensign swift.
the ruler over all mankind moving like bhṛgu in each home.
