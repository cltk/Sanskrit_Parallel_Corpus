that gift of ours which indra loves and welcomes even that he makes for us the great and strong one.
he who comes wielding in his might the thunder maghavan gives prayer praise and laud and soma.
bull hurler of the fouredged rainproducer with both his arms strong mighty most heroic.
wearing as wool paruṣṇī for adornment whose joints for sake of friendship he hath covered.
god who of all the gods was born divinest endowed with ample strength and mighty powers.
and bearing in his arms the yearning thunder with violent rush caused heaven and earth to tremble.
before the high god at his birth heaven trembled earth many floods and all the precipices.
the strong one bringeth nigh the bulls two parents loud sing the winds like men in airs midregion.
these are thy great deeds indra thine the mighty deeds to be told aloud at all libations.
that thou o hero bold and boldly daring didst with thy bolt by strength destroy the dragon.
true are all these thy deeds o most heroic the milchkine issued from the streaming udder.
in fear of thee o thou of manly spirit the rivers swiftly set themselves in motion.
with joy o indra lord of tawny coursers the sisters then these goddesses extolled thee.
when thou didst give the prisoned ones their freedom to wander at their will in long succession.
pressed is the gladdening stalk as twere a river so let the rite the toilers power attract thee.
to usward of the bright one as the courser strains his exceedingly strong leather bridle.
ever by us perform thy most heroic thine highest best victorious deeds o victor.
for us make vṛtras easy to be conquered destroy the weapon of our mortal foeman.
graciously listen to our prayer o indra and strength of varied sort bestow thou on us.
send to us all intelligence arid wisdom o maghavan be he who gives us cattle.
now indra lauded glorified with praises let wealth swell high like rivers to the singer.
for thee a new hymn lord of bays is fashioned may we carborne through song be victors ever.
