now give we praise to dadhikrās the rapid and mention in our laud the earth and heaven.
may the dawns flushing move me to exertion and bear me safely over every trouble.
i praise the mighty steed who fills my spirit the stallion dadhikrāvan rich in bounties.
whom swift of foot and shining bright as agni ye varuṇa and mitra gave to pūrus.
him who hath honoured when the flame is kindled at break of dawn the courser dadhikrāvan.
him of one mind with varuṇa and mitra may aditi make free from all transgression.
when we remember mighty dadhikrāvan our food and strength then the blest name of maruts.
varuṇa mitra we invoke for welfare and agni and the thunderwielding indra.
both sides invoke him as they call on indra when they stir forth and turn to sacrificing.
to us have varuṇa and mitra granted the courser dadhikrās a guide for mortals.
so have i glorified with praise strong dadhikrāvan conquering steed.
sweet may he make our mouths may he prolong the days we have to live.
