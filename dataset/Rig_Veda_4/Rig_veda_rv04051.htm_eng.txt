forth from the darkness in the region eastward this most abundant splendid light hatb mounted.
now verily the farrefulgent mornings daughters of heaven bring welfare to the people.
the richlycoloured dawns have mounted eastward like pillars planted at our sacrifices.
and flushing far splendid and purifying unbarred the portals of the fold of darkness.
dispelling gloom this day the wealthy mornings urge liberal givers to present their treasures.
in the unlightened depth of darkness round them let niggard traffickers sleep unawakened.
o goddesses is this your car i ask you ancient this day or is it new ye mornings.
wherewith rich dawns ye seek with wealth navagva daśagva aṅgira the seventoned singer.
with horses harnessed by eternal order goddesses swiftly round the worlds ye travel.
arousing from their rest o dawns the sleeping and all that lives man bird and beast to motion.
which among these is eldest and where is she through whom they fixed the Ṛbhus regulations.
what time the splendid dawns go forth for splendour they are not known apart alike unwasting.
blest were these dawns of old shining with succour true with the truth that springs from holy order.
with whom the toiling worshipper by praises hymning and lauding soon attained to riches.
hither from eastward all at once they travel from one place spreading in the selfsame manner.
awaking from the seat of holy order the godlike dawns come nigh like troops of cattle.
thus they go forth with undiminished colours these mornings similar in selfsame fashion.
concealing the gigantic might of darkness with radiant bodies bright and pure and shining.
o goddesses o heavens refulgent daughters bestow upon us wealth with store of children.
as from our pleasant place of rest ye rouse us may we be masters of heroic vigour.
wellskilled in lore of sacrifice ye daughters of heaven refulgent dawns i thus address you.
may we be glorious among the people may heaven vouchsafe us this and earth the goddess.
