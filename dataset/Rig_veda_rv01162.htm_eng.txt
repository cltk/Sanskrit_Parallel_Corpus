when we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the strong steed goddescended.
what time they bear before the courser covered with trappings and with wealth the grasped oblation.
the dappled goat goeth straightforward bleating to the place dear to indra and to pūṣan.
dear to all gods this goat the share of pūṣan is first led forward with the vigorous courser.
while tvaṣṭar sends him forward with the charger acceptable for sacrifice to glory.
when thrice the men lead round the steed in order who goeth to the gods as meet oblation.
the goat precedeth him the share of pūṣan and to the gods the sacrifice announceth.

forth for the regions of the gods the charger with his smooth back is come my prayer attends him.
in him rejoice the singers and the sages a good friend have we won for the gods banquet.
may the fleet coursers halter and his heelropes the headstall and the girths and cords about him.
and the grass put within his mouth to bait himamong the gods too let all these be with thee.
what part of the steeds flesh the fly hath eaten or is left sticking to the post or hatchet.
or to the slayers hands and nails adherethamong the gods too may all this be with thee.
food undigested steaming from his belly and any odour of raw flesh remaining.
this let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice with perfect cooking.

let not that lie on earth or grass neglected but to the longing gods let all be offered.
they who observing that the horse is ready call out and say the smell is good remove it.
