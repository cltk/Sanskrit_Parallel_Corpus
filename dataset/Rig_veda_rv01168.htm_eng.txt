swift gain is his who hath you near at every rite ye welcome every song of him who serves the gods.
so may i turn you hither with fair hymns of praise to give great succour for the weal of both the worlds.
surrounding as it were selfborn selfpowerful they spring to life the shakersdown of food and light.
like as the countess undulations of the floods worthy of praise when near like bullocks and like kine.
they who like somas with their wellgrown stalks pressed out imbibed within the heart dwell there in friendly wise.
upon their shoulders rests as twere a warriors spear and in their hand they hold a dagger and a ring.
selfyoked they have descended lightly from the sky with your own lash immortals urge yourselves to speed.
unstained by dust the maruts mighty in their strength have cast down een firm things armed with their shining spears.
who among you o maruts armed with lightningspears moveth you by himself as with the tongue his jaws.
ye rush from heavens floor as though ye sought for food on many errands like the suns diurnal steed.
say where then is this mighty regions farthest bound where maruts is the lowest depth that ye have reached.
when ye cast down like chaff the firmly stablished pile and from the mountain send the glittering waterflood.
your winning is with strength dazzling with heavenly light with fruit mature o maruts fall of plenteousness.
auspicious is your gift like a free givers meed victorious spreading far as of immortal gods.
the rivers roar before your chariot fellies when they are uttering the voice of rainclouds.
the lightnings laugh upon the earth beneath them what time the maruts scatter forth their fatness.
pṛśni brought forth to fight the mighty battle the glittering army of the restless maruts.
nurtured together they begat the monster and then looked round them for the food that strengthens.
may this your laud may this your song o maruts sung by the poet mānas son māndārya.
bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
