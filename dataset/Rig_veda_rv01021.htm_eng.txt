indra and agni i invoke fain are we for their song of praise.
chief somadrinkers are they both.
praise ye o men and glorify indraagni in the holy rites.
sing praise to them in sacred songs.
indra and agni we invite the somadrinkers for the fame.
of mitra to the somadraught.
strong gods we bid them come to this libation that stands ready here.
indra and agni come to us.
indra and agni mighty lords of our assembly crush the fiends.
childless be the devouring ones.
watch ye through this your truthfulness there in the place of spacious view.
indra and agni send us bliss.
