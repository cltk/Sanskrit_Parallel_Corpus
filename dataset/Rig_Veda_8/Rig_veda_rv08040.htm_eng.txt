indra and agni surely ye as conquerors will give us wealth.
whereby in fight we may oercome that which is strong and firmly fixed as agni burns the woods with wind let all the others die away.
we set no snares to tangle you indra we worship and adore hero of heroes mightiest.
once may he come unto us with his steed come unto us to win us strength and to complete the sacrifice.
for famous indraagni ye are dwellers in the midst of frays.
sages in wisdom ye are knit to him who seeketh you as friends heroes bestow on him his wish.
nabhākalike with sacred song indras and agnis praise i sing.
theirs to whom all this world belongs this heaven and this mighty earth which bear rich treasure in their lap.
to indra and to agni send your prayers as was nabhākas wont.
who oped with sideway opening the sea with its foundations sevenindra all powerful in his might.
tear thou asunder as of old like tangles of a creeping plant.
demolish thou the dāsas might may we with indras help divide the treasure he hath gathered up.
what time with this same song these men call indraagni sundry ways.
may we with our own heroes quell those who provoke us to the fight and conquer those who strive with us.
the two refulgent with their beams rise and come downward from the sky.
by indras and by agnis hest flowing away the rivers run which they released from their restraint.
o indra many are thine aids many thy ways of guiding us.
lord of the bay steeds hinvas son to a good hero come our prayers which soon shall have accomplishment.
inspire him with your holy hymns the hero bright and glorious.
him who with might demolisheth even the brood of Śuṣṇa and winneth for us the heavenly streams.
inspire him worshipped with fair rites the glorious hero truly brave.
he brake in pieces Śuṣṇas brood who still expected not the stroke and won for us the heavenly streams let all the others die away.
thus have we sung anew to indraagni as sang our sires aṅgirases and mandhātar.
guard us with triple shelter and preserve us may we be masters of a store of riches.
