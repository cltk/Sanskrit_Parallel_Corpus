prepare oblation let him come and let the minister serve again.
who knows the ordering thereof.
rejoicing in his friendship let the priest be seated over man.
beside the shoot of active power.
him glowing bright beyond all thought they seek among the race of man.
with him for tongue they seize the food.
he hath inflamed the twofold plain lifegiving he hath climbed the wood.
and with his tongue hath struck the rock.
wandering here the radiant calf finds none to fetter him and seeks.
the mother to declare his praise.
and now that great and mighty team the team of horses that are his.
and traces of his car are seen.
the seven milk a single cow the two set other five to work.
on the streams loudresounding bank.
entreated by vivasvāns ten indra cast down the waterjar.
with threefold hammer from the sky.
three times the newlykindled flame proceeds around the sacrifice.
the priests anoint it with the meath.
with reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above.
exhaustless with the mouth below.
the pressingstones are set at work the meath is poured into the tank.
at the outshedding of the fount.
ye cows protect the fount the two mighty ones bless the sacrifice.
the handles twain are wrought of gold.
pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the heaven and earth.
supply the liquid to the bull.
these know their own abidingplace like calves beside the mother cows.
they meet together with their kin.
devouring in their greedy jaws they make sustaining food in heaven.
to indra agni light and prayer.
the pious one milked out rich food sustenance dealt in portions seven.
together with the suns seven rays.
i took some soma when the sun rose up o mitra varuṇa.
that is the sick mans medicine.
from where oblations must be laid which is the wellbeloveds home.
he with his tongue hath compassed heaven.
