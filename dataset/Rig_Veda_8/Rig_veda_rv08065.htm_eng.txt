not to forsake me i invoke this indra girt by maruts.
lord of magic power who rules with might.
this indra with his marut friends clave into pieces vṛtras bead.
with hundredknotted thunderbolt.
indra with marut friends grown strong hath rent asunder vṛtra and.
released the waters of the sea.
this is that indra who begirt by maruts won the light of heaven.
that he might drink the soma juice.
mighty impetuous begirt by maruts him who loudly roars.
indra we invocate with songs.
indra begirt by maruts we invoke after the ancient plan.
that he may drink the soma juice.
o liberal indra marutgirt muchlauded Śatakratu drink.
the soma at this sacrifice.
to thee o indra marutgirt these soma juices thunderer.
are offered from the heart with lauds.
drink indra with thy marut friends pressed soma at the morning rites.
whetting thy thunderbolt with strength.
arising in thy might thy jaws thou shookest indra having quaffed.
the soma which the mortar pressed.
indra both worlds complained to thee when uttering thy fearful roar.
what time thou smotest dasyus dead.
from indra have i measured out a song eightfooted with nine parts.
delicate faithful to the law.
