songlover like a charioteer come songs to thee when soma flows.
o indra they have called to thee as motherkine unto their calves.
bright juices bitherward have sped thee indra lover of the song.
drink indra of this flowing sap in every house tis set for thee.
drink soma to inspirit thee juice indra which the falcon brought.
for thou art king and sovran lord of all the families of men.
o indra hear tirascis call the call of him who serveth thee.
satisfy him with wealth of kine and valiant offspring great art thou.
for he o indra hath produced for thee the newest gladdening song.
a hymn that springs from careful thought ancient and full of sacred truth.

let the pure milky draught delight him strengthened by pure songs of praise.
o indra come thou pure to us with pure assistance pure thyself.
