we compass thee like waters we whose grass is trimmed and soma pressed.
here where the filter pours its stream thy worshippers round thee o vṛtraslayer sit.
men vasu by the soma with lauds call thee to the foremost place.
when comest thou athirst unto the juice as home o indra like a bellowing bull.
boldly bold hero bring us spoil in thousands for the kaṇvas sake.
o active maghavan with eager prayer we crave the yellowhued with store ol kine.
medhyātithi to indra sing drink of the juice to make thee glad.
closeknit to his bay steeds boltarmed beside the juice is he his chariot is of gold.
he who is praised as strong of hand both right and left most wise and hold.
indra who rich in hundreds gathers thousands up honoured as breakerdown of forts.
the bold of heart whom none provokes who stands in bearded confidence.
muchlauded very glorious overthrowing foes strong helper like a bull with might.
who knows what vital ower he wins drinking beside the flowing juice.
this is the fairchecked god who joying in the draught breaks down the castles in his strength.
as a wild elephant rushes on this way and that way mad with heat.
none may compel thee yet come hither to the draught thou movest mighty in thy power.
when he the mighty neer oerthrown steadfast made ready for the fight.
when indra maghavan lists to his praisers call he will not stand aloof but come.
yea verily thou art a bull with a bulls rush whom none may stay.
thou mighty one art celebrated as a bull famed as a bull both near and far.
thy reins are very bulls in strength bulls strength is in thy golden whip.
thy car o maghavan thy bays are strong as bulls thou Śatakratu art a bull.
let the strong presser press for thee bring hither thou straightrushing bull.
the mighty makes the mighty run in flowing streams for thee whom thy bay horses bear.
come thou most potent indra come to drink the savoury soma juice.
maghavan very wise will quickly come to hear the songs the prayer the hymns of praise.
when thou hast mounted on thy car let thy yoked bay steeds carry thee.
past other mens libations lord of hundred powers thee vṛtraslayer thee our friend.
o thou most lofty one accept our laud as nearest to thine heart.
may our libations be most sweet to make thee glad o somadrinker heavenly lord.
neither in thy decree nor mine but in anothers he delights.
the man who brought us unto this.
indra himself hath said the mind of woman brooks not discipline.
her intellect hath little weight.
his pair of horses rushing on in their wild transport draw his car.
highlifted is the stallions yoke.
cast down thine eyes and look not up more closely set thy feet let none.
see what thy garment veils for thou a brahman hast become a dame.
