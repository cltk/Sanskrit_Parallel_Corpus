with wisdom i present these lively praises of bhāvya dweller on the bank of sindhu.
for he unconquered king desiring glory hath furnished me a thousand sacrifices.
a hundred necklets from the king beseeching a hundred giftsteeds i at once accepted.
of the lords cows a thousand i kakṣīvān his deathless glory hath he spread to heaven.
horses of dusky colour stood beside me ten chariots svanayas gift with mares to draw them.
kine numbering sixty thousand followed after kakṣīvān gained them when the days were closing.
forty bay horses of the ten cars master before a thousand lead the long procession.
reeling in joy kakṣīvāns sons and pajras have grounded the coursers decked with pearly trappings.
an earlier gift for you have i accepted eight cows good milkers and three harnessed horses.
pajras who with your wains with your great kinsman like troops of subjects have been fain for glory.
ille loquitur adhaerens arcte adhaerens illa quae mustelae similis se abdidit multum humorem effundens dat mihi complexuum centum gaudia.
ille loquitur prope prope accede molliter me tange ne putes pilos corporis meipaucos esse tota sum villosa sicut gandharium ovis.
