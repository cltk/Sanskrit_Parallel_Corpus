the sacrifice obtains the gods acceptance be graciously inclined to us Ādityas.
hitherward let your favour be directed and be our best deliverer from trouble.
by praisesongs of aṅgirases exalted may the gods come to us with their protection.
may indra with his powers maruts with maruts aditi with Ādityas grant us shelter.
this laud of ours may varuṇa and indra aryaman agni savitar find pleasant.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
