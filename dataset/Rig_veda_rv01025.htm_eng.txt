whatever law of thine o god o varuṇa as we are men.
day after day we violate.
give us not as a prey to death to be destroyed by thee in wrath.
to thy fierce anger when displeased.
to gain thy mercy varuṇa with hymns we bind thy heart as binds.
the charioteer his tethered horse.
they flee from me dispirited bent only on obtaining wealth.
as to their nests the birds of air.
when shall we bring to be appeased the hero lord of warrior might.
him the farseeing varuṇa.
this this with joy they both accept in common never do they fail.
the everfaithful worshipper.
he knows the path of birds that fly through heaven and sovran of the sea.
he knows the ships that are thereon.
true to his holy law he knows the twelve moons with their progeny.
he knows the moon of later birth.
he knows the pathway of the wind the spreading high and mighty wind.
he knows the gods who dwell above.
varuṇa true to holy law sits down among his people he.
most wise sits there to govern all.
from thence a hreferratahtm.
1perceivinga he beholds all wondrous things both what hath been.
and what hereafter will be done.
may that Āditya very wise make fair paths for us all our days.
may he prolong our lives for us.
varuṇa wearing golden mail hath clad him in a shining robe.
his spies are seated found about.
the god whom enemies threaten not nor those who tyrannize oer men.
nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.
he who gives glory to mankind not glory that is incomplete.
to our own bodies giving it.
yearning for the wideseeing one my thoughts move onward unto him.
as kine unto their pastures move.
once more together let us speak because my meath is brought priestlike.
thou eatest what is dear to thee.
now saw i him whom all may see i saw his car above the earth.
he hath accepted these my songs.
varuṇa hear this call of mine be gracious unto us this day.
longing for help i cried to thee.
thou o wise god art lord of all thou art the king of earth and heaven.
hear as thou goest on thy way.
release us from the upper bond untie the bond between and loose.
the bonds below that i may live.
