if indra thou hast given that gracious hearing where with thou helpest those who sang thy praises.
blast not the wish that would exalt us may i gain all from thee and pay all mans devotions.
let not the sovran indra disappoint us in what shall bring both sisters to our dwelling.
to him have run the quickly flowing waters may indra come to us with life and friendship.
victorious with the men hero in battles indra who hears the singers supplication.
will bring his car nigh to the man who offers if he himself upholds the songs that praise him.
yea indra with the men through love of glory consumes the sacred food which friends have offered.
the everstrengthening song of him who worships is sung in fight amid the clash of voices.
aided by thee o maghavan o indra may we subdue our foes who count them mighty.
be our protector strengthen and increase us may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
