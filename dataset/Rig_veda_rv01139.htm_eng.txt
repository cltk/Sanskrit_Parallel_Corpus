heard be our prayer in thought i honour agni first now straightway we elect this heavenly company indra and vāyu we elect.
for when our latest thought is raised and on vivasvān centred well.
then may our holy songs go forward on their way our songs as twere unto the gods.
as there ye mitra varuṇa above the true have taken to yourselves the untrue with your mind with wisdoms mental energy.
so in the seats wherein ye dwell have we beheld the golden one.
not with our thoughts or spirit but with these our eyes yea with the eyes that soma gives.
aśvins the pious call you with their hymns of praise sounding their loud song forth to you these living men to their oblations living men.
all glories and all nourishment lords of all wealth depend on you.
the fellies of your golden chariot scatter drops mighty ones of your golden car.
well is it known o mighty ones ye open heaven for you the chariotsteeds are yoked for morning rites unswerving steeds for morning rites.
we set you on the chariotseat ye mighty on the golden car.
ye seek midair as by a path that leads aright as by a path that leads direct.
o rich in strength through your great power vouchsafe us blessings day and night.
the offerings which we bring to you shall never fail gifts brought by us shall never fail.
these somadrops strong indra drink for heroes poured pressed out by pressingstones are welling forth for thee for thee the drops are welling forth.
they shall make glad thy heart to give to give wealth great and wonderful.
thou who acceptest praise come glorified by hymns come thou to us benevolent.
quickly o agni hear us magnified by us thou shalt speck for us to the gods adorable yea to the kings adorable.
when o ye deities ye gave that milchcow to the aṅgirases.
they milked her aryaman joined with them did the work he knoweth her as well as i.
neer may these manly deeds of yours for us grow old never may your bright glories fall into decay never before our time decay.
what deed of yours new every age wondrous surpassing man rings forth.
whatever maruts may be difficult to gain grant us whateer is hard to gain.
dadhyac of old aṅgiras priyamedha these and kaṇva atri manu knew my birth yea those of ancient days and manu knew.
their long line stretcheth to the gods our birthconnexions are with them.
to these for their high station i bow down with song to indra agni bow with song.
let the invoker bless let offerers bring choice gifts bṛhaspati the friend doth sacrifice with steers steers that have many an excellence.
now with our ears we catch the sound of the pressstone that rings afar.
the very strong hath gained the waters by himself the strong gained many a restingplace.
o ye eleven gods whose home is heaven o ye eleven who make earth your dwelling.
ye who with might eleven live in waters accept this sacrifice o gods with pleasure.
