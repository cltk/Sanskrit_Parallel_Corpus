here is the gear for friction here tinder made ready for the spark.
bring thou the matron we will rub agni in ancient fashion forth.
n the two firesticks jātavedas lieth even as the wellset germ in pregnant women.
agni who day by day must be exalted by men who watch and worship with oblations.
lay this with care on that which lies extended straight hath she borne the steer when made prolific.
with his red pillarradiant is his splendourin our skilled task is born the son of iḷā.
in iḷās place we set thee down upon the central point of earth.
that agni jātavedas thou mayst bear our offerings to the gods.
rub into life ye men the sage the guileless immortal very wise and fair to look on.
o men bring forth the most propitious agni first ensign of the sacrifice to eastward.
when with their arms they rub him straight he shineth forth like a strong courser red in colour in the wood.
bright checkless as it were upon the aśvins path he passeth by the stones and burneth up the grass.
agni shines forth when born observant mighty the bountiful the singer praised by sages.
whom as adorable and knowing all things gods set at solemn rites as offeringbearer.
set thee o priest in thine own place observant lay down the sacrifice in the home of worship.
thou dear to gods shalt serve them with oblation agni give long life to the sacrificer.
raise ye a mighty smoke my fellowworkers ye shall attain to wealth without obstruction.
this agni is the battlewinning hero by whom the gods have overcome the dasyus.
this is thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life thou shonest forth.
knowing this agni sit thee down and prosper thou the songs we sing.
as germ celestial he is called tanūnapāt and narāśaṁsa born diffused in varied shape.
formed in his mother he is mātariśvan he hath in his course become the rapid flight of wind.
with strong attrition rubbed to life laid down with careful hand a sage.
agni make sacrifices good and for the pious bring the gods.
mortals have brought to life the god immortal the conqueror with mighty jaws unfailing.
the sisters ten unwedded and united together grasp the babe the newborn infant.
served by the seven priests he shone forth from ancient time when in his mothers bosom in her lap he glowed.
giving delight each day he closeth not his eye since from the asuras body hewas brought to life.
even as the maruts onslaughts who attack the foe those born the first of all knew the full power of prayer.
the kuśikas have made the glorious hymn ascend and each one singly in his home have kindled fire.
as we o priest observant have elected thee this day what time the solemn sacrifice began.
so surely hast thou worshipped surely hast thou toiled come thou unto the soma wise and knowing all.
