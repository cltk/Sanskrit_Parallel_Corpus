drink indra marutgirt as bull the soma for joy for rapture even as thou listest.
pour down the flood of meath within thy belly thou from of old art king of soma juices.
indra accordant with the banded maruts drink soma hero as wise vṛtraslayer.
slay thou our foemen drive away assailants and make us safe on every side from danger.
and drinker at due seasons drink in season indra with friendly gods our pressedout soma.
the maruts following whom thou madest sharers gave thee the victory and thou slewest vṛtra.
drink soma indra banded with the maruts who maghavan strengthened thee at ahis slaughter.
gainst Śambara lord of bays in winning cattle and now rejoice in thee the holy singers.
the bull whose strength hath waxed whom maruts follow freegiving indra the celestial ruler.
mighty allconquering the victorygiver him let us call to grant us new protection.
