moved indraagni by our hymn come to the juice the precious dew.
drink ye thereof impelled by song.
o indraagni with the man who lauds you comes the wakening rite.
so drink ye both this juice assured.
through force of sacrifice i choose indraagni who love the wise.
with soma let these sate them here.
indra and agni i invoke jointvictors bounteous unsubdued.
foeslayers best to win the spoil.
indra and agni singers skilled in melody hymn you bringing lauds.
i choose you for the sacred food.
indra and agni ye cast down the ninety forts which dƒÅsas held.
together with one mighty deed.
to indraagni reverent thoughts go forward from the holy task.
along the path of sacred law.
o indraagni powers are yours and dwellings and delightful food.
good is your readiness to act.
indra and agni in your deeds of might ye deck heavens lucid realms.
famed is that hero strength of yours.
