agni be kind to us when we approach thee good as a friend to friend as sire and mother.
the races of mankind are great oppressors burn up malignity that strives against us.
agni burn up the unfriendly who are near us burn thou the foemans curse who pays no worship.
burn vasu thou who markest well the foolish let thine eternal nimble beams surround thee.
with fuel agni and with oil desirous mine offering i present for strength and conquest.
with prayer so far as i have power adoringthis hymn divine to gain a hundred treasures.
give with thy glow thou son of strength when lauded great vital power to those who toil to serve thee.
give richly agni to the viśvāmitras in rest and stir oft have we decked thy body.
give us o liberal lord great store of riches for agni such art thou when duly kindled.
thou in the happy singers home bestowest amply with arms extended things of beauty.
