agni quick sage infallible allknowing i choose to be our priest at this oblation.
in our gods service he best skilled shall worship may he obtain us boons for strength and riches.
agni to thee i lift the oilfed ladle bright with an offering bearing our oblation.
from the right hand choosing the gods attendance he with rich presents hath arranged the worship.
of keenest spirit is the man thou aidest give us good offspring thou who givest freely.
in power of wealth most rich in men o agni of thee the good may we sing forth fair praises.
men as they worship thee the god o agni have set on thee full many a brilliant aspect.
so bring most youthful one the gods assembly the heavenly host which thou today shalt honour.
when gods anoint thee priest at their oblation and seat thee for thy task as sacrificer.
o agni be thou here our kind defender and to ourselves vouchsafe the gift of glory.
