my thought with fine discernment hath discovered the cow who wanders free without a herdsman.
her who hath straightway poured me food in plenty indra and agni therefore are her praisers.
indra and pūṣan deft of hand and mighty wellpleased have drained the heavens exhaustless udder.
as in this praise the gods have all delighted may i win blessing here from you o vasus.
fain to lend vigour to the bull the siste with reverence recognize the germ within him.
the cows come lowing hither to the youngling to him endued with great and wondrous beauties.
fixing with thought at sacrifice the pressstones i bid the wellformed heaven and earth come hither.
for these thy flames which give men boons in plenty rise up on high the beautiful the holy.
agni thy meathsweet tongue that tastes fair viands which among gods is called the farextended.
therewith make all the holy odes be seated here for our help and feed them with sweet juices.
let thy stream give us drink o god o agni wonderful and exhaustless like the rainclouds.
thus care for us o vasu jātavedas show us thy lovingkindness reaching all men.
