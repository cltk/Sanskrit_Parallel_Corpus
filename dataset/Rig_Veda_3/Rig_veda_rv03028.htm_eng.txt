agni who knowest all accept our offering and the cake of meal.
at dawns libation rich in prayer.
agni the sacrificial cake hath been prepared and dressed for thee.
accept it o most youthful god.
agni enjoy the cake of meal and our oblation three days old.
thou son of strength art stablished at our sacrifice.
here at the midday sacrifice enjoy thou the sacrificial cake wise jƒÅtavedas.
agni the sages in assemblies never minish the portion due to thee the mighty.
o agni at the third libation takewith joy the offered cake of sacrifice thou son of strength.
through skill in song bear to the gods our sacrifice watchful and fraught with riches to immortal god.
o waxing agni knower thou of all accept our gifts the cake.
and that prepared ere yesterday.
