come to us indra from afar conducting us even as a lord of heroes to the gatherings home like a king his heroes lord.
we come with gifts of pleasant food with juice poured forth invoking thee.
as sons invite a sire that thou mayst get thee strength thee bounteousest to get thee strength.
o indra drink the soma juice pressed out with stones poured from the reservoir as an ox drinks the spring a very thirsty bull the spring.
for the sweet draught that gladdens thee for mightiest freshening of thy strength.
let thy bay horses bring thee hither as the sun as every day they bring the sun.
he found the treasure brought from heaven that lay concealed closehidden like the nestling of a bird in rock enclosed in neverending rock.
best aṅgiras boltarmed he strove to win as twere the stall of kine.
so indra hath disclosed the food concealed disclosed the doors the food that lay concealed.
grasping his thunderbolt with both hands indra made its edge most keen for hurling like a carvingknife for ahis slaughter made it keen.
endued with majesty and strength o indra and with lordly might.
thou crashest down the trees as when a craftsman fells crashest them down as with an axe.
thou indra without effort hast let loose the floods to run their free course down.
like chariots to the sea like chariots showing forth their strength.
they reaching hence away have joined their strength for one eternal end.
even as the cows who poured forth every thing for man yea poured forth all things for mankind.
eager for riches men have formed for thee this song like as a skilful craftsman fashioneth a car so have they wrought thee to their bliss.
adorning thee o singer like a generous steed for deeds of might.
yea like a steed to show his strength and win the prize that he may bear each prize away.
for pūru thou hast shattered indra ninety forts for divodāsa thy boon servant with thy bolt o dancer for thy worshipper.
for atithigva he the strong brought Śambara from the mountain down.
distributing the mighty treasures with his strength parting all treasures with his strength.
indra in battles help his Āryan worshipper he who hath hundred helps at hand in every fray in frays that win the light of heaven.
plaguing the lawless he gave up to manus seed the dusky skin.
blazing twere he burns each covetous man away he burns the tyrannous away.
waxed strong in might at dawn he tore the suns wheel off bright red he steals away their speech the lord of power their speech he steals away from them.
as thou with eager speed o sage hast come from far away to help.
as winning for thine own all happiness of men winning all happiness each day.
lauded with our new hymns o vigorous in deed save us with strengthening help thou shatterer of the forts.
thou indra praised by divodāsas clansmen as heaven grows great with days shalt wax in glory.
