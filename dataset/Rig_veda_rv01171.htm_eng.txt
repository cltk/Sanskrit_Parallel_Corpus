to you i come with this mine adoration and with a hymn i crave the strong ones favour.
a hymn that truly makes you joyful maruts suppress your anger and unyoke your horses.
maruts to you this laud with prayer and worship formed in the mind and heart ye gods is offered.

i fled in a hreferratahtm.
6terrora from this mighty indra my body trembling in alarm o maruts.
oblations meant for you had been made ready these have we set aside for this forgive us.
by whom the mƒÅnas recognize the daysprings by whose strength at the dawn of endless mornings.
give us thou mighty glory with maruts fierce with the fierce the strong who givest triumph.
do thou o indra guard the conquering heroes and rid thee of thy wrath against the maruts.
with them the wise victorious and bestowing may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
