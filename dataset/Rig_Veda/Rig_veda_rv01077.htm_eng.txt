how shall we pay oblation unto agni what hymn godloved is said to him refulgent.
who deathless true to law mid men a herald bringeth the gods as best of sacrificers.
bring him with reverence hither most propitious in sacrifices true to law the herald.
for agni when he seeks the gods for mortals knows them full well and worships them in spirit.
for he is mental power a man and perfect he is the bringer friendlike of the wondrous.
the pious Āryan tribes at sacrifices address them first to him who doeth marvels.
may agni foedestroyer manliest hero accept with love our hymns and our devotion.
so may the liberal lords whose strength is strongest urged by their riches stir our thoughts with vigour.
thus agni jātavedas true to order hath by the priestly gotamas been lauded.
may he augment in them splendour and vigour observant as he lists he gathers increase.
