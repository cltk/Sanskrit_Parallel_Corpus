ask ye of him for he is come he knoweth it he full of wisdom is implored is now implored.
with him are admonitions and with him commands he is the lord of strength the lord of power and might.
they ask of him not all learn by their questioning what he the sage hath grasped as twere with his own mind.
forgetting not the former nor the later word he goeth on not careless in his mental power.
to him these ladles go to him these racing mares he only will give ear to all the words i speak.
allspeeding victor perfecter of sacrifice the babe with flawless help hath mustered vigorous might.
whateer he meets he grasps and then runs farther on and straightway newly born creeps forward with his kin.
he stirs the wearied man to pleasure and great joy what time the longing gifts approach him as he comes.
he is a wild thing of the flood and forest he hath been laid upon the highest surface.
he hath declared the lore of works to mortals agni the wise for he knows law the truthful.
