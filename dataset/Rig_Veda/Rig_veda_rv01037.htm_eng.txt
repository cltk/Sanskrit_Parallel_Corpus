sing forth o kaṇvas to your band of maruts unassailable.
sporting resplendent on their car.
they who selfluminous were born together with the spotted deer.
spears swords and glittering ornaments.
one hears as though twere close at hand the cracking of the whips they hold.
they gather glory on their way.
now sing ye forth the godgiven hymn to your exultant marut host.
the fiercelyvigorous the strong.
praise ye the bull among the cows for tis the maruts sportive band.
it strengthened as it drank the rain.
who is your mightiest heroes when o shakers of the earth and heaven.
ye shake them like a garments hem.
at your approach man holds him down before the fury of your wrath.
the ruggedjointed mountain yields.
they at whose racings forth the earth like an ageweakened lord of men.
trembles in terror on their ways.
strong is their birth vigour have they to issue from their mother strength.
yea even twice enough is theirs.
and these the sons the singers in their racings have enlarged the bounds.
so that the kine must walk kneedeep.
before them on the ways they go they drop this offspring of the cloud.
long broad and inexhaustible.
o maruts as your strength is great so have ye cast men down on earth.
so have ye made the mountains fall.
the while the maruts pass along they talk together on the way.
doth any hear them as they speak.
come quick with swift steeds for ye have worshippers among kaṇvas sons.
may you rejoice among them well.
all is prepared for your delight we are their servants evermore.
to live as long as life may last.
