thou art the king of all the gods o indra protect the men o asura preserve us.
thou lord of heroes maghavan our saver art faithful very rich the victorygiver.
indra thou humbledst tribes that spake with insult by breaking down seven autumn forts their refuge.
thou stirredst blameless billowy floods and gavest his foe a prey to youthful purukutsa.
with whom thou drivest troops whose lords are heroes and bringest daylight now much worshipped indra.
with them guard lionlike wasting active agni to dwell in our tilled fields and in our homestead.
they through the greatness of thy spear o indra shall to thy praise rest in this earthly station.
to loose the floods to seek for kine the battle his bays he mounted boldly seized the booty.
indra bear kutsa him in whom thou joyest the darkred horses of the wind are docile.
let the sun roll his chariot wheel anear us and let the thunderer go to meet the foemen.
thou indra lord of bays made strong by impulse hast slain the vexers of thy friends who give not.
they who beheld the friend beside the living were cast aside by thee as they rode onward.
indra the bard sang forth in inspiration thou madest earth a covering for the dāsa.
maghavan made the three that gleam with moisture and to his home brought kuyavāc to slay him.
these thine old deeds new bards have sung o indra thou conqueredst boundest many tribes for ever.
like castles thou hast crushed the godless races and bowed the godless scorners deadly weapon.
a stormer thou hast made the stormy waters flow down o indra like the running rivers.
when oer the flood thou broughtest them o hero thou keptest turvaśa and yadu safely.
indra mayst thou be ours in all occasions protector of the men most gentlehearted.
giving us victory over all our rivals may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
