indra the singers with high praise indra reciters with their lauds.
indra the choirs have glorified.
indra hath ever close to him his two bay steeds and wordyoked car.
indra the golden thunderarmed.
indra hath raised the sun on high in heaven that he may see afar.
he burst the mountain for the kine.
help us o indra in the frays yea frays where thousand spoils are gained.
with awful aids o awful one.
in mighty battle we invoke indra indra in lesser fight.
the friend who bends his bolt at fiends.
unclose our manly hero thou for ever bounteous yonder cloud.
for us thou irresistible.
still higher at each strain of mine thunderarmed indras praises rise.
i find no laud worthy of him.
even as the bull drives on the herds he drives the people with his might.
the ruler irresistible.
indra who rules with single sway men riches and the fivefold race.
of those who dwell upon the earth.
for your sake from each side we call indra away from other men.
ours and none othersÂ’ may he be.
