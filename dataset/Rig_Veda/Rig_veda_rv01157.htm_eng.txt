agni is wakened sūrya riseth from the earth mighty refulgent dawn hath shone with all her light.
the aśvins have equipped their chariot for the course god savitar hath moved the folk in sundry ways.
when aśvins ye equip your very mighty car bedew ye twain our power with honey and with oil.
to our devotion give victorious strength in war may we win riches in the heroes strife for spoil.
nigh to us come the aśvins lauded threewheeled car the car laden with meath and drawn by fleetfoot steeds.
threeseated opulent bestowing all delight may it bring weal to us to cattle and to men.
bring hither nourishment for us ye aśvins twain sprinkle us with your whip that drops with honeydew.
prolong our days of life wipe out our trespasses destroy our foes be our companions and our friends.
ye store the germ of life in female creatures ye lay it up within all living beings.
ye have sent forth o aśvins passing mighty the fire the sovrans of the wood the waters.
leeches are ye with medicines to heal us and charioteers are ye with skill in driving.
ye strong give sway to him who brings oblation and with his heart pours out his gift before you.
