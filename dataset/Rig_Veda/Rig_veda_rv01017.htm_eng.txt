i crave help from the imperial lords from indravaruṇa may they.
both favour one of us like me.
guardians of men ye ever come with ready succour at the call.
of every singer such as i.
sate you according to your wish o indravaruṇa with wealth.
fain would we have you nearest us.
may we be sharers of the powers sharers of the benevolence.
of you who give strength bounteously.
indra and varuṇa among givers of thousands meet for praise.
are powers who merit highest laud.
through their protection may we gain great store of wealth and heap it up.
enough and still to spare be ours.
o indravaruṇa on you for wealth in many a form i call.
still keep ye us victorious.
o indravaruṇa through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves.
give us at once your sheltering help.
o indravaruṇa to you may fair praise which i offer come.
joint eulogy which ye dignify.
