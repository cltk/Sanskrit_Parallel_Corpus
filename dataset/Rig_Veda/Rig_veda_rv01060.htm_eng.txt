as twere some goodly treasure mātariśvan brought as a gift the glorious priest to bhṛgu.
banner of sacrifice the good protector child of two births the swiftly moving envoy.
both gods and men obey this rulers order gods who are worshipped men who yearn and worship.
as priest he takes his seat ere break of morning houselord adorable with men ordainer.
may our fair praise heartborn most recent reach him whose tongue een at his birth is sweet as honey.
whom mortal priests men with their strong endeavour supplied with dainty viands have created.
good to mankind the yearning purifier hath among men been placed as priest choiceworthy.
may agni be our friend lord of the household protector of the riches in the dwelling.
as such we gotamas with hymns extol thee o agni as the guardian lord of riches.
decking thee like a horse the swift prizewinner may he enriched with prayer come soon and early.
