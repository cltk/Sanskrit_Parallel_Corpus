still in vaiśvānaras grace may we continue yea he is king supreme oer all things living.
sprung hence to life upon this all he looketh vaiśvānara hath rivalry with sūrya.
present in heaven in earth allpresent agniall plants that grow on ground hath he pervaded.
may agni may vaiśvānara with vigour present preserve us day and night from foemen.
be this thy truth vaiśvānara to usward let wealth in rich abundance gather round us.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
