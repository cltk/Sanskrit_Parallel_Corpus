graciously listen to our songs maghavan be not negligent.
as thou hast made us full of joy and lettest us solicit thee now indra yoke thy two bay steeds.
well have they eaten and rejoiced the friends have risen and passed away.
the sages luminous in themselves have praised thee with their latest hymn now indra yoke thy two bay steeds.
maghavan we will reverence thee who art so fair to look upon.
thus praised according to our wish come now with richly laden car now indra yoke thy two bay steeds.
he will in very truth ascend the powerful car that finds the kine.
who thinks upon the wellfilled bowl the tawny coursers harnesser now indra yoke thy two bay steeds.
let lord of hundred powers thy steeds be harnessed on the right and left.
therewith in rapture of the juice draw near to thy beloved spouse now indra yoke thy two bay steeds.
with holy prayer i yoke thy longmaned pair of bays come hitherward thou holdest them in both thy hands.
the stirring draughts of juice outpoured have made thee glad thou thunderer hast rejoiced with pūṣan and thy spouse.
