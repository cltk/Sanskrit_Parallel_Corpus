when thus like flame from far away maruts ye cast your measure forth.
to whom go ye to whom o shakers of the earth moved by whose wisdom whose design.
strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes firm for resistance let them be.
yea passing glorious must be your warrior might not as a guileful mortals strength.
when what is strong ye overthrow and whirl about each ponderous thing.
heroes your course is through the forest trees of earth and through the fissures of the rocks.
consumers of your foes no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth.
ye rudras may the strength held in this bond be yours to bid defiance even now.
they make the mountains rock and reel they rend the forestkings apart.
onward ye maruts drive like creatures drunk with wine ye gods with all your company.
ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer a red deer as a leader draws.
even the earth herself listened as ye came near and men were sorely terrified.
o rudras quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours.
come to us with your aid as in the days of old so now for frightened kaṇvas sake.
should any monstrous foe o maruts sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us.
tear ye him from us with your power and with your might and with the succours that are yours.
for ye the worshipful and wise have guarded kaṇva perfectly.
o maruts come to us with full protecting help as lightning flashes seek the rain.
whole strength have ye o bounteous ones perfect earthshakers is your might.
maruts against the poets wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.
