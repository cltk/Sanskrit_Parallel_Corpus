i will declare the mighty deeds of viṣṇu of him who measured out the earthly regions.
who propped the highest place of congregation thrice setting down his footstep widely striding.
for this his mighty deed is viṣṇu lauded like some wild beast dread prowling mountainroaming.
he within whose three wideextended paces all living creatures have their habitation.
let the hymn lift itself as strength to viṣṇu the bull farstriding dwelling on the mountains.
him who alone with triple step hath measured this common dwellingplace long far extended.
him whose three places that are filled with sweetness imperishable joy as it may list them.
who verily alone upholds the threefold the earth the heaven and all living creatures.
may i attain to that his wellloved mansion where men devoted to the gods are happy.
for there springs close akin to the widestrider the well of meath in viṣṇus highest footstep.
fain would we go unto your dwellingplaces where there are manyhorned and nimble oxen.
for mightily there shineth down upon us the widelystriding bulls sublimest mansion.
