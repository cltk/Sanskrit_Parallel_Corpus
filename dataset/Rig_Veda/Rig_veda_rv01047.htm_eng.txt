aŚvins for you who strengthen law this sweetest soma hath been shed.
drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it.
come o ye aśvins mounted on your triple car threeseated beautiful of form.
to you at sacrifice the kaṇvas send the prayer graciously listen to their call.
o aśvins ye who strengthen law drink ye this sweetest soma juice.
borne on your wealthfraught car come ye this day to him who offers ye of wondrous deeds.
omniscient aśvins on the thriceheaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the sacrifice.
the sons of kaṇva striving heavenward call on you with draughts of soma juice outpoured.
o aśvins with those aids wherewith ye guarded kaṇva carefully.
keep us o lords of splendour drink the soma juice ye strengtheners of holy law.
o mighty ones ye gave sudās abundant food brought on your treasureladen car.
so now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave either from heaven or from the sea.
nāsatyas whether ye be far away or close to turvaśa.
borne on your lightlyrolling chariot come to us together with the sunbeams come.
so let your coursers ornaments of sacrifice bring you to our libations here.
bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright sit chiefs upon the sacred grass.
come o nāsatyas on your car decked with a sunbright canopy.
whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper to drink the somas pleasant juice.
with lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us that they most rich may succour us.
for ye have ever in the kaṇvas wellloved house o aśvins drunk the soma juice.
