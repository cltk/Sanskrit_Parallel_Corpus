neer is he injured whom the gods varuṇa mitra aryaman.
the excellently wise protect.
he prospers ever free from scathe whom they as with full hands enrich.
whom they preserve from every foe.
the kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies.
and lead him safely oer distress.
thornless Ādityas is the path easy for him who seeks the law.
with him is naught to anger you.
what sacrifice Ādityas ye heroes guide by the path direct.
may that come nigh unto your thought.
that mortal ever unsubdued gains wealth and every precious thing.
and children also of his own.
how my friends shall we prepare aryamans and mitras laud.
glorious food of varuṇa.
i point not out to you a man who strikes the pious or reviles.
only with hymns i call you nigh.
let him not love to speak ill words but fear the one who holds all four.
within his hand until they fall.
