to this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught thou art invoked.
o agni with the maruts come.
no mortal man no god exceeds thy mental power o mighty one.
o agni with the maruts come.
all gods devoid of guile who know the mighty region of midair.
o agni with those maruts come.
the terrible who sing their song not to be overcome by might.
o agni with those maruts come.
brilliant and awful in their form mighty devourers of their foes.
o agni with those maruts come.
who sit as deities in heaven above the skyvaults luminous sphere.
o agni with those maruts come.
who scatter clouds about the sky away over the billowy sea.
o agni with those maruts come.
who with their bright beams spread them forth over the ocean in their might.
o agni with those maruts come.
for thee to be thine early draught i pour the somamingled meath.
o agni with the maruts come.
