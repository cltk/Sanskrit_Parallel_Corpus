for the celestial race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly.
was made by singers with their lips.
they who for indra with their mind formed horses harnessed by a word.
attained by works to sacrifice.
they for the two nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way.
they formed a nectaryielding cow.
the Ṛbhus with effectual prayers honest with constant labour made.
their sire and mother young again.
together came your gladdening drops with indra by the maruts girt.
with the Ādityas with the kings.
the sacrificial ladle wrought newly by the god tvaṣṭars hand.
four ladles have ye made thereof.
vouchsafe us wealth to him who pours thrice seven libations yea to each.
give wealth pleased with our eulogies.
as ministering priests they held by pious acts they won themselves.
a share in sacrifice with gods.
