pour on us with thy juice all kinds of corn each sort of nourishment.
and soma all felicities.
as thine o indu is the praise and thine what springeth from the juice.
seat thee on the dear sacred grass.
and finding for us kine and steeds o soma with thy juice flow on.
through days that fly most rapidly.
as one who conquers neÂ’er subdued attacks and stays the enemy.
thus vanquisher of thousands flow.
