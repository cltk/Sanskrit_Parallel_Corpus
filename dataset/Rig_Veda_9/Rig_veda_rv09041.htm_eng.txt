active and bright have they come forth impetuous in speed like bulls.
driving the black skin far away.
quelling the riteless dasyu may we think upon the bridge of bliss.
leaving the bridge of woe behind.
the mighty pavamanas roar is heard as twere the rush of rain.
lightnings are flashing to the sky.
pour out on us abundant food when thou art pressed o indu wealth.
in kine and gold and steeds and spoil.
flow on thy way most active thou fill full the mighty heavens and earth.
as dawn as sūrya with his beams.
on every side o soma flow round us with thy protecting stream.
as rasā flows around the world.
