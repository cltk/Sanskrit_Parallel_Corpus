stream on us riches that are sought by many best at winning strength.
riches o indu thousandfold glorious conquering the great.
effused he hath as on a car invested him in fleecy mail.
onward hath indu flowed in streams impelled surrounded by the wood.
effused this indu hath flowed on distilling rapture to the fleece.
he goes erect as seeking kine in stream with light to sacrifice.
for thou thyself o indu god to every mortal worshipper.
attractest riches thousandfold made manifest in hundred forms.
good vṛtraslayer may we be still nearest to this wealth of thine.
which many crave nearest to food and happiness resistless one.
whom bright with native splendour crushed between the pair of pressingstones.
the wavy friend whom indra lovesthe twicefive sisters dip and bathe.
him with the fleece they purify brown goldenhued beloved of all.
who with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the deities.
through longing for this sap of yours ye drink what brings ability.
even him who dear as heavens own light gives to our princes high renown.
indu at holy rites produced you heaven and earth the friends of men.
hillhaunting god the goddesses they bruised him where the roar was loud.
for vṛtraslaying indra thou soma art poured that he may drink.
poured for the guerdongiving man poured for the god who sitteth there.
these ancient somas at the break of day have flowed into the sieve.
snorting away at early morn these foolish evilhearted ones.
friends may the princes ye and we obtain this most resplendent one.
gain him who hath the smell of strength win him whose home is very strength.
