they for the bold and lovely one ply manly vigour like a bow.
joyous in front of songs they weave bright raiment for the lord divine.
and he made beautiful by night dips forward into strengthening food.
what time the sacrificers thoughts speed on his way the goldenhued.
we cleanse this gladdening drink of his the juice which indra chiefly drinksÂ—.
that which kine took into their mouths of old and princes take it now.
to him while purifying they have raised the ancient psalm of praise.
and sacred songs which bear the names of gods have supplicated him.
they purify him as he drops courageous in the fleecy sieve.
him they instruct as messenger to bear the sages morning prayer.
soma best cheerer takes his seat the while they cleanse him in the bowls.
he as it were impregns the cow and babbles on the lord of song.
he is effused and beautified a god for gods by skilful men.
he penetrates the mighty floods collecting all he knows therein.
pressed indu guided by the men thou art led to the cleaning sieve.
thou yielding indra highest joy takest thy seat within the bowls.
