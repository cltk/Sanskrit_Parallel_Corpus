on flows the stream of soma who beholds mankind by everlasting law he calls the gods from heaven.
he lightens with the roaring of br aspati h the lakes have not contained the pourings of juice.
thou powerful soma thou to whom the cows have lowed ascendest bright with sheen thine ironfashioned home.
thou lengthening our princes life and high renown flowest for indra as his might to gladdening drink.
best giver of delight he flows to indras throat robing himself in might auspicious one for fame.
he spreads himself abroad to meet all things that be the vigorous tawny steed flows sporting on his way.
the men the ten swift fingers milk thee out for gods even thee most rich in meath with thousand flowing streams.
soma who winnest thousands driven by the men expressed with stones bring as thou flowest all the gods.
defthanded men with stones the ten swift fingers drain thee into waters thee the steer enriched with sweets.
thou soma gladdening indra and the heavenly host flowest as pavamana like a rivers wave.
