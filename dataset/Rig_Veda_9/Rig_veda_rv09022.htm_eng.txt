these rapid somastreams have stirred themselves to motion like strong steeds.
like cars like armies hurried forth.
swift as wide winds they lightly move like rainstorms of parjanya like.
the flickering flames of burning fire.
these soma juices blent with curds purified skilled in sacred hymns.
have gained by song their heartsdesire.
immortal cleansed these drops since first they flowed have never wearied fain.
to reach the regions and their paths.
advancing they have travelled oÂ’er the ridges of the earth and heaven.
and this the highest realm of all.
over the heights have they attained the highest thread that is spun out.
and this which must be deemed most high.
thou soma boldest wealth in kine which thou hast seized from niggard churls.
thou calledst forth the outspun thread.
