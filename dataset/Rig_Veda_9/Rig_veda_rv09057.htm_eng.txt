thy streams that never fail or waste flow forth like showers of rain from heaven.
to bring a thousand stores of strength.
he flows beholding on his way all wellbeloved sacred lore.
greentinted brandishing his arms.
he when the people deck him like a docile king of elephants.
sits as a falcon in the wood.
so bring thou hitherward to us indu while thou art purified.
all treasures both of heaven and earth.
