onward to indras throat move beauteously adorned the waves of soma as he purifies himself.
when they brought forward with the lovely curd of kine effused have cheered the hero to bestow his gifts.
hither hath soma flowed unto the beakers like a chariothorse a stallion swift upon his way.
thus knowing both the generations he obtains the rights and dues of gods from yonder and from hence.
while thou art cleansed o soma scatter wealth on us indu bestow great bounty as a liberal prince.
giver of life with wisdom help to opulence strew not our home possessions far away from us.
hither let pūṣan pavamana come to us varuṇa mitra bountiful of one accord.
the maruts aśvins vāyu and bṛhaspati savitar tvaṣṭar tractable sarasvatī.
both heaven and earth the allinvigorating pair vidhatar aditi and aryaman the god.
bhaga who blesses men the spacious firmamentlet all the gods in pavamana take delight.
