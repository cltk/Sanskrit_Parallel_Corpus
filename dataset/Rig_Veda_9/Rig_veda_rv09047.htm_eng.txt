great as he was soma hath gained strength by this high solemnity.
joyous he riseth like a bull.
his task is done his crushings of the dasyus are made manifest.
he sternly reckoneth their debts.
soon as his song of praise is born the soma indras juice becomes.
a thousandwinning thunderbolt.
seer and sustainer he himself desireth riches for the sage.
when he embellisheth his songs.
fain would they both win riches as in races of the steeds in war.
thou art upon the conquerors side.
