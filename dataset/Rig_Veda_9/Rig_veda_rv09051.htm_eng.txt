adhvaryu on the filter pour the soma juice expressed with stones.
and make it pure for indras drink.
pour out for indra thunderarmed the milk of heaven the somas juice.
most excellent most rich in sweets.
these gods and all the marut host indu enjoy this juice of thine.
this pavamanas flowing meath.
for soma thou hast been effused strengthening for the wild carouse.
o steer the singer for our help.
flow with thy stream farsighted one effused into the cleansing sieve.
flow on to give us strength and fame.
