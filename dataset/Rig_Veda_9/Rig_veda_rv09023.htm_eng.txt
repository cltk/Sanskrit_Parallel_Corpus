swift soma drops have been effused in streams of meath the gladdening drink.
for sacred lore of every kind.
hither to newer restingplace the ancient living ones are come.
they made the sun that he might shine.
o pavamana bring to us the unsacrificing foemans wealth.
and give us food with progeny.
the living somas being cleansed diffuse exhilarating drink.
turned to the vat which drips with meath.
soma gows on intelligent possessing sap and mighty strength.
brave hero who repels the curse.
for indra soma thou art cleansed a feastcompanion for the gods.
ndu thou fain wilt win us strength.
when he had drunken draughts of this indra smote down resistless foes.
yea smote them and shall smite them still.
