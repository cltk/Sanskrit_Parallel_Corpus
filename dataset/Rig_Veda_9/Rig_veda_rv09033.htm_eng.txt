like waves of waters skilled in song the juices of the soma speed.
onward as buffaloes to woods.
with stream of sacrifice the brown bright drops have flowed with strength in store.
of kine into the wooden vats.
to indra vāyu varuṇa to viṣṇu and the maruts flow.
the drops of soma juice effused.
three several words are uttered kine are owing cows who give their milk.
the tawnyhued goes bellowing on.
the young and sacred mothers of the holy rite have uttered praise.
they decorate the child of heaven.
from every side o soma for our profit pour thou forth four seas.
filled full of riches thousandfold.
