on flows the potent juice sustainer of the heavens the strength of gods whom men must hail with shouts of joy.
the goldhued started like a courser by brave men impetuously winneth splendour in the streams.
he takes his weapons like a hero in his hands fain to win light carborne in forays for the kine.
indu while stimulating indias might is urged forward and balmed by sages skilful in their task.
soma as thou art purified with flowing wave exhibiting thy strength enter thou indras throat.
make both worlds stream for us as lightning doth the clouds mete out exhaustless powers for us as twere through song.
onward he flows the king of all that sees the light the Ṛṣis lord hath raised the song of sacrifice.
even he who is adorned with sūryas arrowy beam father of hymns whose wisdom is beyond our reach.
like as a bull to herds thou flowest to the pail bellowing as a steer upon the waters lap.
so best of cheerers thou for indra flowest on that we with thy protection may oercome in fight.
