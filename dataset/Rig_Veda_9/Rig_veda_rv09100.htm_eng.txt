the guileless ones are singing praise to indras well beloved friend.
as in the morning of its life the mothers lick the newborn calf.
o indu while they cleanse thee bring o soma doublywaxing wealth.
thou in the worshippers abode causest all treasures to increase.
set free the song which mind hath yoked even as thunder frees the rain.
all treasures of the earth and heaven o soma thou dost multiply.
thy stream when thou art pressed runs on like some victorious warriors steed.
hastening onward through the fleece like a fierce horse who wins the prize.
flow on sage soma with thy stream to give us mental power and strength.
effused for indra for his drink for mitra and for varuṇa.
flow to the filter with thy stream effused best winner thou of spoil.
o soma as most rich in sweets for indra viṣṇu and the gods.
the mothers void of guiles caress thee goldencoloured in the sieve.
as cows o pavamana lick the newborn calf as law commands.
thou pavamana movest on with wondrous rays to great renown.
striving within the votarys house thou drivest all the glooms away.
lord of great sway thou liftest thee above the heavens above the earth.
thou pavamana hast assumed thy coat of mail in majesty.
