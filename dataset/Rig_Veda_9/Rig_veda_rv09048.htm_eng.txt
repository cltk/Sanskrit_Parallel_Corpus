with sacrifice we seek to thee kind cherisher of manly might.
in mansions of the lofty heavens.
gladdening crusher of the bold ruling with very mighty sway.
destroyer of a hundred forts.
hence sapient one the falcon strong of wing unwearied brought thee down.
lord over riches from the sky.
that each may see the light the bird brought us the guard of law the friend.
of all the speeder through the air.
and now sent forth it hath attained to mighty power and majesty.
most active ready to assist.
