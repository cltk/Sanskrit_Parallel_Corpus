reposing on the rivers wave the sage hath widely flowed around.
bearing the hymn which many love.
when the five kindred companies active in duty with the song.
establish him the powerful.
then in his juice whose strength is great have all the gods rejoiced themselves.
when he hath clothed him in the milk.
freeing himself he flows away leaving his bodys severed limbs.
and meets his own companion here.
he by the daughters of the priest like a fair youth hath been adorned.
making the milk as Â’twere his robe.
oer the fine fingers through desire of milk in winding course he goes.
and utters voice which he hath found.
the nimble fingers have approached adorning him the lord of strength.
they grasp the vigorous coursers back.
comprising all the treasures that are in the heavens and on the earth.
come soma as our faithful friend.
