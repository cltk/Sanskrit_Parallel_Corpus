here present this immortal god flies like a bird upon her wings.
to settle in the vats of wood.
this god made ready with the hymn runs swiftly through the winding ways.
inviolable as he flows.
this god while flowing is adorned like a bay steed for war by men.
devout and skilled in holy songs.
he like a warrior going forth with heroes as he flows along.
is fain to win all precious boons.
this god as he is flowing on speeds like a car and gives his gifts.
he lets his voice be heard of all.
praised by the sacred bards this god dives into waters and bestows.
rich gifts upon the worshipper.
away he rushes with his stream across the regions into heaven.
and roars as he is flowing on.
while flowing meet for sacrifice he hath gone up to heaven across.
the regions irresistible.
after the way of ancient time this god pressed out for deities.
flows tawny to the strainingcloth.
this lord of many holy laws even at his birth engendering strength.
effused flows onward in a stream.
