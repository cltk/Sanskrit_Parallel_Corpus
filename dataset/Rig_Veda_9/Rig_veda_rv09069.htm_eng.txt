laid like an arrow on the bow the hymn hath been loosed like a young calf to the udder of its dam.
as one who cometh first with full stream she is milked the soma is impelled to this mans holy rites.
the thought is deeply fixed the savoury juice is shed the tongue with joyous sound is stirring in the mouth.
and pavamana like the shout of combatants the drop rising in sweet juice is flowing through the fleece.
he flows about the sheepskin longing for a bride he looses aditis daughters for the worshipper.
the sacred drink hath come goldtinted wellrestrained like a strong bull he shines whetting his manly might.
the bull is bellowing the cows are coming nigh the goddesses approach the gods own restingplace.
onward hath soma passed through the sheeps fair bright fleece and hath as twere endued a garment newly washed.
the goldenhued immortal newly bathed puts on a brightly shining vesture that is never harmed.
he made the ridge of heaven to be his radiant robe by sprinkling of the bowls from moisture of the sky.
even as the beams of sūrya urging men to speed that cheer and send to sleep together rush they forth.
these swift outpourings in long course of holy rites no form save only indra shows itself so pure.
as down the steep slope of a river to the vale drawn from the steer the swift strong draughts have found a way.
well be it with the men and cattle in our home may powers o soma may the people stay with us.
pour out upon us wealth in goods in gold in steeds in cattle and in corn and great heroic strength.
ye soma are my fathers lifted up on high as heads of heaven and makers of the strength of life.
these pavamanas here these drops of soma to indra have sped forth like cars to booty.
effused they pass the cleansing fleece while goldhued they cast their covering off to pour the rain down.
o indu flow thou on for lofty indra flow blameless very gracious foedestroyer.
bring splendid treasures to the man who lauds thee o heaven and earth with all the gods protect us.
