swift to the purifying sieve flows soma as exalted law.
slaying the fiends loving the gods.
when soma pours the strengthening food a hundred everactive streams.
to indras friendship win theirway.
ten dames have sung to welcome thee even as a maiden greets her love.
o soma thou art decked to win.
flow hitherward o indu sweet to indra and to viṣṇu guard.
the men the singers from distress.
