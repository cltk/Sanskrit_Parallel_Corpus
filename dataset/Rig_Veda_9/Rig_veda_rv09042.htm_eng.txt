engendering the sun in floods engendering heavens lights greenhued.
robed in the waters and the milk.
according to primeval plan this soma with his stream effused.
flows purely on a god for gods.
for him victorious waxen great the juices with a thousand powers.
are purified for winning spoil.
shedding the ancient fluid he is poured into the cleansing sieve.
he thundering hath produced the gods.
soma while purifying sends hither all things to be desired.
he sends the gods who strengthen law.
soma effused pour on us wealth in kine in heroes steeds and spoil.
send us abundant store of food.
