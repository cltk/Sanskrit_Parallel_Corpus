flow onward soma winning kine and steeds and all that gives delight.
bring hither wealth with progeny.
flow onward from the waters flow inviolable from the plants.
flow onward from the pressingboards.
soma as pavamana pass over all trouble and distress.
sit on the sacred grass a sage.
thou pavamana foundest light thou at thy birth becamest great.
o indu thou art over all.
