we will enrobe with sacred song the lovely one who as a steed.
is decked with milk for rapturous joy.
all songs of ours desiring grace adorn him in the ancient way.
indu for indra for his drink.
soma flows on when purified beloved and adorned with songs.
songs of the sage medhyƒÅtithi.
o soma pavamana find exceeding glorious wealth for us.
wealth indu fraught with boundless might.
like courser racing to the prize indu the lover of the gods.
roars as he passes in the sieve.
flow on thy way to win us strength to speed the sage who praises thee.
soma bestow heroic power.
