greenhued as one who giveth strength flow on for gods to drink a draught.
for vāyu and the marut host.
o pavamana sent by song roaring about thy dwellingplace.
pass into vāyu as law bids.
the steer shines with the deities dear sage in his appointed home.
foeslayer most beloved by gods.
taking each beauteous form he goes desirable while purified.
thither where the immortals sit.
to indra soma flows the red engendering song exceeding wise.
the visitor of living men.
flow best exhilarator sage flow to the filter in a stream.
to seat thee in the place of song.
