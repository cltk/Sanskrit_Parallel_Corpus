the drop of soma juice effused flows onward with this stream impelled.
rending strong places with its might.
poured forth to indra varuṇa to vāyu and the marut hosts.
to viṣṇu flows the soma juice.
with stones they press the soma forth the strong conducted by the strong.
they milk the liquor out with skill.
tis he whom trita must refine tis he who shall make indra glad.
the tawny one is decked with tints.
him do the sons of pṛśni milk the dwellingplace of sacrifice.
oblation lovely and most dear.
to him in one unitcd stream thse songs flow on straight forward he.
loud voiced hath made the milchkine low.
