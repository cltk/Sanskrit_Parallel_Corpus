o soma being purified bring us the wondrous treasure meet.
for lauds that is in earth and heaven.
for ye twain indra soma are lords of the light lords of the kine.
great rulers prosper ye our songs.
the tawny steer while cleansed among the living bellowing on the grass.
hath sunk and settled in his home.
over the steers productive flow the sacred songs were resonant.
the mothers of the darling son.
hath he not purified impregned the kine whb long to meet their lord.
the kine who yield the shining milk.
bring near us those who stand aloof strike fear into our enemies.
o pavamana find us wealth.
soma bring down the foemans might his vigorous strength and vital power.
whether he be afar or near.
