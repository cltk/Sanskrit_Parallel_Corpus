on that most wondrous car of yours o indra and agni which looks round on all things living.
take ye your stand and come to us together and drink libations of the flowing soma.
as vast as all this world is in its compass deep as it is with its farstretching surface.
so let this soma be indra and agni made for your drinking till your soul be sated.
for ye have won a blessed name together yea with one aim ye strove o vṛtraslayers.
so indraagni seated here together pour in ye mighty ones the mighty soma.
both stand adorned when fires are duly kindled spreading the sacred grass with lifted ladles.
drawn by strong soma juice poured forth around us come indraagni and display your favour.
the brave deeds ye have done indra and agni the forms ye have displayed and mighty exploits.
the ancient and auspicious bonds of friendshipfor sake of these drink of the flowing soma.
as first i said when choosing you in battle we must contend with asuras for this soma.
so came ye unto this my true conviction and drank libations of the flowing soma.
if in your dwelling or with prince or brahman ye indraagni holy ones rejoice you.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libation of the flowing soma.
if with the yadus turvaśas ye sojourn with druhyus anus pūrus indraagni.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libations of the flowing soma.
whether o indraagni ye be dwelling in lowest earth in central or in highest.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libations of the flowing soma.
whether o indraagni ye be dwelling in highest earth in central or in lowest.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libations of the flowing soma.
whether ye be in heaven o indraagni on earth on mountains in the herbs or waters.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libations of the flowing soma.
if when the sun to the midheaven hath mounted ye take delight in food o indraagni.
even from thence ye mighty lords come hither and drink libations of the flowing soma.
thus having drunk your fill of our libation win us all kinds of wealth indra and agni.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
