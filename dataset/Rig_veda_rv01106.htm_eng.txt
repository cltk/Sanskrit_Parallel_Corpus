call we for aid on indra mitra varuṇa and agni and the marut host and aditi.
even as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
come ye Ādityas for our full prosperity in conquests of the foe ye gods bring joy to us.
even as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
may the most glorious fathers aid us and the two goddesses mothers of the gods who strengthen law.
even as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
to mighty narāśaṁsa strengthening his might to pūṣan ruler over men we pray with hymns.
even as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
bṛhaspati make us evermore an easy path we crave what boon thou hast for men in rest and stir.
like as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
sunk in the pit the Ṛṣi kutsa called to aid indra the vṛtraslayer lord of power and might.
even as a chariot from a difficult ravine bountiful vasus rescue us from all distress.
may aditi the goddess guard us with the gods may the protecting god keep us with ceaseless care.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
