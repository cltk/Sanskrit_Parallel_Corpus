as forth to sacrifice we go a hymn to a hymn let us say.
who hears us even when afar.
who from of old in carnage when the people gathered hath preserved.
his household for the worshipper.
and let men say agni is born een he who slayeth vṛtra he.
who winneth wealth in every fight.
him in whose house an envoy thou lovest to taste his offered gifts.
and strengthenest his sacrifice.
him aṅgiras thou son of strength all men call happy in his god.
his offerings and his sacred grass.
hitherward shalt thou bring these gods to our laudation and to taste.
these offered gifts fairshining one.
when agni on thine embassage thou goest not a sound is heard of steed or straining of thy car.
aided by thee uninjured strong one after other goes he forth.
agni the offerer forward steps.
and splendid strength heroic high agni thou grantest from the gods.
thou god to him who offers gifts.
