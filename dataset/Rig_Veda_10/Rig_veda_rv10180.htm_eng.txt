o muchinvoked thou hast subdued thy foemen thy might is loftiest here display thy bounty.
in thy right hand o indra bring us treasures thou art the lord of rivers filled with riches.
like a dread wild beast roaming on the mountain thou hast approached us from the farthest distance.
whetting thy bold and thy sharp blade o indra crush thou the foe and scatter those who hate us.
thou mighty indra sprangest into being as strength for lovely lordship oÂ’er the people.
thou drovest off the folk who were unfriendly and to the gods thou gavest room and freedom.
