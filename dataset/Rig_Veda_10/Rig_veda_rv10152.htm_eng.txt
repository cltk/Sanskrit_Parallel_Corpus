a mighty governor art thou wondrous destroyer of the foe.
whose friend is never done to death and never never overcome.
lord of the clan who brings us bliss strong warrior slayer of the fiend.
may india somadrinker go before us bull who gives us peace.
drive rākṣasas and foes away break thou in pieces vṛtrasjaws.
o vṛtraslaying indra quell the foemans wrath who threatens us.
o indra beat our foes away humble the men who challenge us.
send down to nether darkness him who seeks to do us injury.
baffle the foemans plan ward off his weapon who would conquer us.
give shelter from his furious wrath and keep his murdering dart afar.
