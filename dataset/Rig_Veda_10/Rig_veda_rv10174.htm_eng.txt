with offering for success in fight whence indra was victorious.
with this o brahmaṇaspati let us attain to royal sway.
subduing those who rival us subduing all malignities.
withstand the man who menaces withstand the man who angers us.
soma and savitar the god have made thee a victorious king.
all elements have aided thee to make thee general conqueror.
oblation that which indra gave and thus grew glorious and most high.
this have i offered gods and hence now verily am rivalless.
slayer of rivals rivalless victorious with royal sway.
over these beings may i rule may i be sovran of the folk.
