for iṭas sake who pressed the juice thou indra didst protect his car.
and hear the somagivers call.
thou from his skin hast borne the head of the swiftmoving combatant.
and sought the somapourers home.
venya that mortal man hast thou for Āstrabudhna the devout.
o indra many a time set free.
bring indra to the east again that sun who now is in the west.
even against the will of gods.
