instruct me all ye gods how i elected your priest must seat me here and how address you.
instruct me how to deal to each his portion and by what  path to bring you mans oblation.
i sit as priest most skilled in sacrificing the maruts and all deities impel me.
aśvins each day yours is the adhvaryus duty brahman and wood are here tis yours to offer.
who is the priest is he the priest of yama on whom is thrust this godappointed honour.
he springs to life each month each day that passes so gods have made him their oblationbearer.
the gods have made me bearer of oblations who slipped away and passed through many troubles.
wise agni shall ordain for us the worship whether fivewayed threefold or seventhreaded.
so will i win you strength and life for ever o gods that i may give you room and freedom.
to indras arms would i consign the thunder in all these battles shall he then be victor.
the deities three hundred and thirtynine have served and honoured agni.
strewn sacred grass anointed him with butter and seated him as priest the gods invoker.
