when vasu wilt thou love the laud now let the channel bring the stream.
the juice is ready to ferment.
he whose two bay steeds harnessed well swerving pursue the birds tailplumes.
with rowing manes like heaven and earth he is the lord with power to give.
bereft of skill is indra if like some outwearied man he fears.
the sinner when the mighty hath prepared himself for victory.
indra with these drives round until he meets with one to worship him.
indra is master of the pair who snort and swerve upon their way.
borne onward by the longmaned steeds who stretch themselves as twere for food.
the god who wears the helm defends them with his jaws.
the mighty sang with lofty ones the hero fashioned with his strength.
like skilful mātariśvan with his power and might.
the bolt which pierced at once the vitals of the dasyu easy to be slain.
with jaw uninjured like the wondrous firmament.
grind off our sins with song will we conquer the men who sing no hymns.
not easily art thou pleased with prayerless sacrifice.
when threefold flame burns high for thee to rest on poles of sacrifice.
thou with the living joyest in the selfbright ship.
thy glory was the speckled cup thy glory was the flawless scoop.
wherewith thou pourest into thy receptacle.
as hundreds o immortal god have sung to thee so hath sumitra yea durmitra praised thee here.
what time thou holpest kutsas son when dasyus fell yea holpest kutsas darling when the dasyus died.
