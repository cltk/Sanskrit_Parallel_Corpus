no peril no severe distress ye gods affects the mortal man.
whom aryaman and mitra lead and varima of one accord beyond his foes.
this very thing do we desire varuṇa mitra aryaman.
whereby ye guhrd the mortal man from sore distress and lead him safe beyond his foes.
these are each one our present helps varuṇa mitra aryaman.
best leaders best deliverers to lead us on and bear as safe beyond our foes.
ye compass round and guard each man varuṇa mitra aryaman.
in your dear keeping may we be ye who are excellent as guides beyond our foes.
Ādityas are beyond all foesvaruṇa mitra aryaman.
strong rudra with the marut host indra agni let us call for weal beyond our foes.
these lead us safely over all varuṇa mitra aryaman.
these who are kings of living men over all troubles far away beyond our foes.
may they give bliss to aid us well varuṇa mitra aryaman.
may the Ādityas when we pray grant us wide shelter and defence beyond our foes.
as in this place o holy ones ye vasus freed even the gaud when her feet were fettered.
so free us now from trouble and affliction and let our life be lengthened still o api.
