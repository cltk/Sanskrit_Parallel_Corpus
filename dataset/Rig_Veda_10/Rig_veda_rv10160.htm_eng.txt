taste this strong draught enriched with offered viands with all thy chariot here unyoke thy coursers.
let not those other sacrificers stay thee indra these juices shed for thee are ready.
thine is the juice effused thine are the juices yet to be pressed our resonant songs invite thee.
o indra pleased today with this libation come thou who knowest all and drink the soma.
whoso devoted to the god effuses soma for him with yearning heart and spiritÂ—.
never doth indra give away his cattle for him he makes the lovely soma famous.
he looks with ioving favour on the mortal who like a rich man pours for him the soma.
maghavan in his bended arm supports him he slays unasked the men who hate devotion.
we call on thee to come to us desirous of goods and spoil of cattle and of horses.
for thy new love and favour are we present let us invoke thee indra as our welfare.
