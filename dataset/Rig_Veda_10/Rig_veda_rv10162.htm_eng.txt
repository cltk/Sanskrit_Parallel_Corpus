may agni yielding to our prayer the rakṣasslayer drive away.
the malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.
agni concurring in the prayer drive off the eater of the flesh.
the malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and womb.
that which destroys the sinking germ the settled moving embryo.
that which will kill the babe at birtheven this will we drive far away.
that which divides thy legs that it may lie between the married pair.
that penetrates and licks thy sideeven this will we exterminate.
what rests by thee in borrowed form of brother lover or of lord.
and would destroy thy progenyeven this will we exterminate.
that which through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and lies down by thee.
and will destroy thy progenyeven this will we exterminate.
