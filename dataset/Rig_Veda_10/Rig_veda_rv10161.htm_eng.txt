for life i set thee free by this oblation from the unknown decline and from consumption.
or if the grasping demon have possessed him free him from her o indra thou and agni.
be his days ended be he now departed be he brought very near to death already.
out of destructions lap again i bring him save him for life to last a hundred autumns.
with hundredeyed oblation hundredautumned bringing a hundred lives have i restored him.
that indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther shore of all misfortune.
live waxing in thy strength a hundred autumns live through a hundred springs a hundred winters.
through hundredlived oblation indra agni bá¹›haspati savitar yield him for a hundred.
so have i found and rescued thee thou hast returned with youth renewed.
whole in thy members i have found thy sight and all thy life for thee.
