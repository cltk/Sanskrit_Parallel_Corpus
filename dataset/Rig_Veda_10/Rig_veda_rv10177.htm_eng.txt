the sapient with their spirit and their mind behold the bird adorned with all an asuras magic might.
sages observe him in the oceans inmost depth the wise disposers seek the station of his rays.
the flying bird bears speech within his spirit erst the gandharva in the womb pronounced it.
and at the seat of sacrifice the sages cherish this radiant heavenlybright invention.
i saw the herdsman him who never resteth approaching and departing on his pathways.
he clothed in gathered and diffusive splendour within the worlds continually travels.
