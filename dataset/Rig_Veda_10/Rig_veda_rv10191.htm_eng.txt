thou mighty agni gatherest up all that is precious for thy friend.
bring us all treasures as thou art enkindled in libations place.
assemble speak together let your minds be all of one accord.
as ancient gods unanimous sit down to their appointed share.
the place is common common the assembly common the mind so be their thought united.
a common purpose do i lay before you and worship with your general oblation.
one and the same be your resolve and be your minds of one accord.
united be the thoughts of all that all may happily agree.
