ye by your hymns are like highthoughted singers skilful inviting gods with sacrifices.
fair to behold like kings with bright adornment like spotless gallants leaders of the people.
like fire with flashing flame breastbound with chains of gold like tempestblasts selfmoving swift to lend your aid.
as best of all foreknowers excellent to guide like somas good to guard the man who follows law.
shakers of all like gales of wind they travel like tongues of burning fires in their effulgence.
mighty are they as warriors clad in armour and like the fathers prayers most bounteous givers.
like spokes of carwheels in one nave united ever victorious like heavenly heroes.
shedding their precious balm like youthful suitors they raise their voice and chant their psalm as singers.
they who are fleet to travel like the noblest steeds long to obtain the prize like bounteous charioteers.
like waters speeding on with their precipitous floods like omniform aṅgirases with sāmahymns.
born from the stream like pressstones are the princes for ever like the stones that crush in pieces.
sons of a beauteous dame like playful children like a great host upon the march with splendour.
like rays of dawn the visitors of sacrifice they shine with ornaments as eager to be bright.
like rivers hasting on glittering with their spears from far away they measure out the distances.
gods send us happiness and make us wealthy letting us singers prosper o ye maruts.
bethink you of our praise and of our friendship ye from of old have riches to vouchsafe us.
