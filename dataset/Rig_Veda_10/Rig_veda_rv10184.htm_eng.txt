may viṣṇu form and mould the womb may tvaṣṭar duly shape the forms.
prajāpati infuse the stream and dhātar lay the germ for thee.
o sinīvālī set the germ set thou the germ sarasvatī.
may the twain gods bestow the germ the aśvins crowned with lotuses.
that which the aśvins twain rub forth with the attritionsticks of gold.
that germ of thine we invocate that in the tenth month thou mayst bear.
