see vena born in light hath driven hither on chariot of the air the calves of pṛśni.
singers with hymns caress him as an infant there where the waters and the sunlight mingle.
vena draws up his wave from out the ocean mistborn the fair ones back is made apparent.
brightly he shone aloft on orders summit the hosts sang glory to their common birthplace.
full many lowing to their jointpossession dwelling together stood the darlings mothers.
ascending to the lofty height of order the bands of singers sip the sweets of amṛta.
knowing his form the sages yearned to meet him they have come nigh to hear the wild bulls bellow.
performing sacrifice they reached the river for the gandharva found the immortal waters.
the apsaras the lady sweetly smiling supports her lover in sublimest heaven.
in his friends dwelling as a friend he wanders he vena rests him on his golden pinion.
they gaze on thee with longing in their spirit as on a strongwinged bird that mounteth skyward.
on thee with wings of gold varuṇas envoy the bird that hasteneth to the home of yama.
erect to heaven hath the gandharva mounted pointing at us his manycoloured weapons.
clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on for he as light produceth forms that please us.
when as a spark he cometh near the ocean still looking with a vultures eye to heaven.
his lustre joying in its own bright splendour maketh dear glories in the lowest region.
