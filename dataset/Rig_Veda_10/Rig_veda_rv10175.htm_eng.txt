may savitar the god o stones stir you according to the law.
be harnessed to the shafts and press.
stones drive calamity away drive ye away malevolence.
make ye the cows our medicine.
of one accord the upper stones giving the bull his bulllike strength.
look down with pride on those below.
may savitar the god o stones stir you as law commands for him.
who sacrifices pouring juice.
