ye waters are beneficent so help ye us to energy.
that we may look on great delight.
give us a portion of the sap the most auspicious that ye have.
like mothers in their longing love.
to you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on.
and waters give us procreant strength.
the waters be to us for drink goddesses for our aid and bliss.
let them stream to us health and strength.
beg the floods to give us balm these queens who rule oÂ’er precious things.
and have supreme control of men.
within the waterssoma thus hath told medwell all balms that heal.
and agni he who blesseth all.
o waters teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm.
so that i long may see the sun.
whatever sin is found in me whatever evil i have wrought.
if i have lied or falsely sworn waters remove it far from me.
the waters i this day have sought and to their moisture have we come.
o agni rich in milk come thou and with thy splendour cover me.
