o jātavedas when thou hast matured him then send him on his way unto the fathers.
when thou hast made him ready jātavedas then do thou give him over to the fathers.

thy portion is the goat with heat consume him let thy fierce flame thy glowing splendour burn him.
with thine auspicious forms o jātavedas bear this man to the region of the pious.
again o agni to the fathers send him who offered in thee goes with our oblations.
wearing new life let him increase his offspring let him rejoin a body jātavedas.
what wound soeer the dark bird hath inflicted the emmet or the serpent or the jackal.
may agni who devoureth all things heal it and soma who hath passed into the brahmans.
shield thee with flesh against the flames of agni encompass thee about with fat and marrow.
so will the bold one eager to attack thee with fierce glow fail to girdle and consume thee.
