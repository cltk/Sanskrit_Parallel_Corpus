do homage unto varuṇas and mitras eye offer this solemn worship to the mighty god.
who seeth far away the ensign born of gods sing praises unto sūrya to the son of dyaus.
may this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever heaven and earth and days are spread abroad.
all else that is in motion finds a place of rest the waters ever flow and ever mounts the sun.
no godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving forth with winged dappled steeds.
one lustre waits upon thee moving to the cast and sūrya thou arisest with a different light.
o sūrya with the light whereby thou scatterest gloom and with thy ray impellest every moving thing.
keep far from us all feeble worthless sacrifice and drive away disease and every evil dream.
sent forth thou guardest well the universes law and in thy wonted way arisest free from wrath.
when sūrya we address our prayers to thee today may the gods favour this our purpose and desire.
this invocation these our words may heaven and earth and indra and the waters and the maruts hear.
neer may we suffer want in presence of the sun and living happy lives may we attain old age.
cheerful in spirit evermore and keen of sight with store of children free from sickness and from sin.
longliving may we look o sūrya upon thee uprising day by day thou great as mitra is.
sūrya may we live long and look upon thee still thee o farseeing one bringing the glorious light.
the radiant god the spring of joy to every eye as thou art mounting up oer the high shining flood.
thou by whose lustre all the world of life comes forth and by thy beams again returns unto its rest.
o sūrya with the golden hair ascend for us day after day still bringing purer innocence.
bless us with shine bless us with perfect daylight bless us with cold with fervent heat and lustre.
bestow on us o sūrya varied riches to bless us in our home and when we travel.
gods to our living creatures of both kinds vouchsafe protection both to bipeds and to quadrupeds.
that they may drink and eat invigorating food so grant us health and strength and perfect innocence.
if by some grievous sin we have provoked the gods o deities with the tongue or thoughtlessness of heart.
that guilt o vasus lay upon the evil one on him who ever leads us into deep distress.
