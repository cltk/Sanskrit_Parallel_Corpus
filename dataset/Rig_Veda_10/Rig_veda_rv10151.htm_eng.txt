by faith is agni kindled through faith is oblation offered up.
we celebrate with praises faith upon the height of happiness.
bless thou the man who gives o faith faith bless the man who fain would give.
bless thou the liberal worshippers bless thou the word that i have said.
even as the deities maintained faith in the mighty asuras.
so make this uttered wish of mine true for the liberal worshippers.
guarded by vāyu gods and men who sacrifice draw near to faith.
man winneth faith by yearnings of the heart and opulence by faith.
faith in the early morning faith at noonday will we invocate.
faith at the setting of the sun o faith endow us with belief.
