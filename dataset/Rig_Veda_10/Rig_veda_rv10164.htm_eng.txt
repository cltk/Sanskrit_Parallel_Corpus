avaunt thou master of the mind depart and vanish far away.
look on destruction far from hence the live mans mind is manifold.
a happy boon do men elect a mighty blessing they obtain.
bliss with vaivasvata they see the live mans mind seeks many a place.
if by address by blame by imprecation we have committed sin awake or sleeping.
all hateful acts of ours all evil doings may agni bear away to distant places.
when indra brahmaṇaspati our deeds are wrongful and unjust.
may provident aṅgirasa prevent our foes from troubling us.
we have prevailed this day and won we are made free from sin and guilt.
ill thoughts that visit us awake or sleeping seize the man we hate yea seize the man who hateth us.
