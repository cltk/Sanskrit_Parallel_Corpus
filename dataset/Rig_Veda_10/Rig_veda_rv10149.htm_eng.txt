savitar fixed the earth with bands to bind it and made heaven stedfast where no prop supported.
savitar milked as twere a restless courser air sea bound fast to what no foot had trodden.
well knoweth savitar o child of waters where ocean firmly fixt oerflowed its limit.
thence sprang the world from that uprose the region thence heaven spread out and the wide earth expanded.
then with a full crowd of immortal beings this other realm came later high and holy.
first verily savitars strongpinioned eagle was born and he obeys his law for ever.
as warriors to their steeds kine to their village as fond milk giving cows approach their youngling.
as man to wife let savitar come downward to us heavens bearer lord of every blessing.
like the aṅgirasa hiranvastupa i call thee savitar to this achievement.
so worshipping and lauding thee for favour i watch for thee as for the stalk of soma.
