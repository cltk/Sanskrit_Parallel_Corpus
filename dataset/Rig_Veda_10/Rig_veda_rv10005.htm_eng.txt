he only is the sea holder of treasures born many a time he views the hearts within us.
he hides him in the secret couples bosom the bird dwells in the middle of the fountain.
inhabiting one dwellingplace in common strong stallions and the mares have come together.
the sages guard the seat of holy order and keep the highest names concealed within them.
the holy pair of wondrous power have coupled they formed the infant they who bred produced him.
the central point of all that moves and moves not the while they wove the sages thread with insight.
for tracks of order and refreshing viands attend from ancient times the goodly infant.
wearing him as a mantle earth and heaven grow strong by food of pleasant drink and fatness.
he calling loudly to the seven red sisters hath skilled in sweet drink brought them to be looked on.
he born of old in middle air hath halted and sought and found the covering robe of pūṣan.
seven are the pathways which the wise have fashioned to one of these may come the troubled mortal.
he standeth in the dwelling of the highest a pillar on sure ground where paths are parted.
not being being in the highest heaven in aditis bosom and in dakṣas birthplace.
is agni our firstborn of holy order the milchcow and the bull in lifes beginning.
