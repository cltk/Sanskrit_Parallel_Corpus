may sūrya guard us out of heaven and vāta from the firmament.
and agni from terrestrial spots.
thou savitar whose flame deserves hundred libations be thou pleased.
from failing lightning keep us safe.
may savitar the god and may parvata also give us sight.
may the creator give us sight.
give sight unto our eye give thou our bodies sight that they may see.
may we survey discern this world.
thus sūrya may we look on thee on thee most lovely to behold.
see clearly with the eyes of men.
