drive all our enemies away o indra the western mighty conqueror and the eastern.
hero drive off our northern foes and southern that we in thy wide shelter may be joyful.
what then as men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe corn removing it in order.
so bring the food of those men bring it hither who went not to prepare the grass for worship.
men come not with one horse at sacred seasons thus they obtain no honour in assemblies.
sages desiring herds of kine and horses strengthen the mighty indra for his friendship.
ye aśvins lords of splendour drank full draughts of grateful soma juice.
and aided indra in his work with namuci of asura birth.
as parents aid a son both aśvins indra aided thee with their wondrous powers and wisdom.
when thou with might hadst drunk the draught that gladdens sarasvatī o maghavan refreshed thee.
indra is strong to save rich in assistance may he possessing all be kind and gracious.
may he disperse our foes and give us safety and may we be the lords of hero vigou r.
may we enjoy his favour his the holy may we enjoy his blessed loving kindness.
may this rich indra as our good protector drive off and keep afar all those who hate us.
