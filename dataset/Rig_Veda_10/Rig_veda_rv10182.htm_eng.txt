bṚhaspati lead us safely over troubles and turn his evil thought against the sinner.
repel the curse and drive away illfeeling and give the sacrificer peace and comfort.
may narāśaṁsa aid us at prayāja blest be our anuyāja at invokings.
may he repel the curse and chase illfeeling and give the sacrificer peace and comfort.
may he whose head is flaming burn the demons haters of prayer so that the arrow slay them.
may he repel the curse and chase illfeeling and give the sacrificer peace and comfort.
