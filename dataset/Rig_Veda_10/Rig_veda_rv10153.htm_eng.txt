swaying about the active ones came nigh to indra at his birth.
and shared his great heroic might.
based upon strength and victory and power o indra is thy birth.
thou mighty one art strong indeed.
thou art the vá¹›traslayer thou indra hast spread the firmament.
thou hast with might upheld the heavens.
thou indra bearest in thine arms the lightning that accords with thee.
whetting thy thunderbolt with might.
thou indra art preeminent over all creatures in thy might.
thou hast pervaded every place.
