be with us i have chosen thee stand stedfast and immovable.
let all the people wish for thee let not thy kingship fall away.
be even here fall not away be like a mountain unremoved.
stand stedfast here like indras self and hold the kingship in the grasp.
this man hath indra stablished made secure by strong oblations power.
may soma speak a benison and brahmaṇaspati on him.
firm is the sky and firm the earth and stedfast also are these hills.
stedfast is all this living world and stedfast is this king of men.
stedfast may varuṇa the king stedfast the god bṛhaspati.
stedfast may indra stedfast too may agni keep thy stedfast reign.
on constant soma let us think with constant sacrificial gift.
and then may indra make the clans bring tribute unto thee alone.
