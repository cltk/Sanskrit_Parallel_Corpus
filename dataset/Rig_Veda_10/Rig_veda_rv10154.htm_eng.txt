for some is soma purified some sit by sacrificial oil.
to those for whom the meath flows forth even to those let him depart.
invincible through fervour those whom fervour hath advanced to heaven.
who showed great fervour in their lives even to those let him depart.
the heroes who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away.
or who give guerdon thousandfold even to those let him depart.
yea the first followers of law laws pure and holy strengtheners.
the fathers yama fervourmovedeven to those let him depart.
skilled in a thousand ways and means the sages who protect the sun.
the Ṛṣis yama fervourmovedeven to those let him depart.
