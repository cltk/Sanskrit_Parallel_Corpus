to agni send i forth my song to him the bull of all the folk.
so may he bear us past our foes.
who from the distance far away shines brilliantly across the wastes.
so may he bear us past our foes.
the bull with brightlygleaming flame who utterly consumes the fiends.
so may he bear us past our foes.
who looks on all existing things and comprehends them with his view.
so may he bear us past our foes.
resplendent agni who was born in farthest region of the air.
so may he bear us past our foes.
