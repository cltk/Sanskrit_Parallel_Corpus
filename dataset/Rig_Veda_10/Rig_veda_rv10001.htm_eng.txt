high hath the mighty risen before the dawning and come to us with light from out the darkness.
fairshapen agni with whiteshining splendour hath filled at birth all human habitations.
thou being born art child of earth and heaven parted among the plants in beauty agni.
the glooms of night thou brilliant babe subduest and art come forth loud roaring from thy mothers.
here being manifested lofty viṣṇu full wise protects his own supremest station.
when they have offered in his mouth their sweet milk to him with one accord they sing forth praises.
thence bearing food the mothers come to meet thee with food for thee who givest food its increase.
these in their altered form again thou meetest thou art invoking priest in homes of mortals.
priest of the holy rite with car that glitters refulgent banner of each act of worship.
sharinging every god through might and glory even agni guest of men i summon hither.
so agni stands on earths most central station invested in welldecorated garments.
born red of hue where men pour out libations o king as great high priest bring the gods hither.
over the earth and over heaven o agni thou son hast ever spread above thy parents.
come youthfullest to those who long to meet thee and hither bring the gods o mighty victor.
