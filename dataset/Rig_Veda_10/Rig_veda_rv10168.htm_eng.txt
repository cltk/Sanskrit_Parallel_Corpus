o the winds chariot o its power and glory crashing it goes and hath a voice of thunder.
it makes the regions red and touches heaven and as it moves the dust of earth is scattered.
along the traces of the wind they hurry they come to him as dames to an assembly.
borne on his car with these for his attendants the god speeds forth the universes monarch.
travelling on the paths of airs midregion no single day doth he take rest or slumber.
holy and earliestborn friend of the waters where did he spring and from what region came he.
germ of the world the deitiesÂ’ vital spirit this god moves ever as his will inclines him.
his voice is heard his shape is ever viewless let us adore this wind with our oblation.
