this even this was my resolve to win a cow to win a steed.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
like violent gusts of wind the draughts that i have drunk have lifted me.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
the draughts i drank have borne me up as fleetfoot horses draw a car.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
the hymn hath reached me like a cow who lows to meet her darling calf.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
as a wright bends a chariotseat so round my heart i bend the hymn.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
not as a mote within the eye count the five tribes of men with me.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
the heavens and earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of me.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
i in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious earth.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
aha this spacious earth will i deposit either here or there.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
in one short moment will i smite the earth in fury here or there.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
one of my flanks is in the sky i let the other trail below.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
greatest of the mighty ones am lifted to the firmament.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
i seek the worshippers abode oblationbearer to the gods.
have i not drunk of soma juice.
