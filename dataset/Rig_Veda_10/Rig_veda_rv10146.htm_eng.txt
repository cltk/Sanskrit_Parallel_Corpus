goddess of wild and forest who seemest to vanish from the sight.
how is it that thou seekest not the village art thou not afraid.
what time the grasshopper replies and swells the shrill cicalas voice.
seeming to sound with tinkling bells the lady of the wood exults.
and yonder cattle seem to graze what seems a dwellingplace appears.
or else at eve the lady of the forest seems to free the wains.
here one is calling to his cow another there hath felled a tree.
at eve the dweller in the wood fancies that somebody hath screamed.
the goddess never slays unless some murderous enemy approach.
man eats of savoury fruit and then takes even as he wills his rest.
now have i praised the forest queen sweetscented redolent of balm.
the mother of all sylvan things who tills not but hath stores of food.
