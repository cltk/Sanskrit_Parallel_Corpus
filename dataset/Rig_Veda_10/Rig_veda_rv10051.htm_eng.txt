large was that covering and firm of texture folded wherein thou enteredst the waters.
one deity alone o jātavedas agni saw all thy forms in sundry places.
what god hath seen me who of all their number clearly beheld my forms in many places.
where lie then all the sacred logs of agni that lead him godward varuṇa and mitra.
in many places agni jātavedas we sought thee hidden in the plants and waters.
then yama marked thee god of wondrous splendour effulgent from thy tenfold secret dwelling.
i fled in fear from sacrificial worship varuṇa lest the gods should thus engage me.
thus were my forms laid down in many places this as my goal i agni saw before me.
come man is pious and would fain do worship he waits prepared in gloom thou agni dwellest.
make pathways leading godward clear and easy and bear oblations with a kindly spirit.
this goal mine elder brothers erst selected as he who drives a car the way to travel.
sovaruṇa i fled afar through terror as flies the wildbull from an archers bowstring.
we give thee life unwasting jātavedas so that employed thou never shalt be injured.
so nobly born shalt thou with kindly spirit bear to the gods their share of mens oblations.
grant me the first oblations and the latter entire my forceful shares of holy presents.
the soul of plants the fatness of the waters and let there be long life ye gods to agni.
thine be the first oblations and the latter entire thy forceful shares of holy presents.
let all this sacrifice be thine o agni and let the worlds four regions how before thee.
