where is famed indra heard of with what folk is he renowned today as mitra is.
who in the home of Ṛṣis and in secret is extolled with song.
even here is indra famed and among us this day the glorious thunderer is praised.
he who like mitra mid the folk hath won complete and full renown.
he who is sovran lord of great and perfect strength exerter of heroic might.
who bears the fearless thunder as a father bears his darling son.
harnessing to thy car as god two blustering steeds of the windgod o thunderer.
that speed along the shining path thou making ways art glorified.
even to these dark steeds of wind thou of thyself hast come to ride.
of which no driver may be found none be he god or mortal man.
when ye approach men ask you thee and uśanā why come ye to our dwellingplace.
why are ye come to mortal man from distant realms of eapth and heaven.
o indra thou shalt speak us fair our holy prayer is offered up.
we pray to thee for help as thou didst strike the monster Śuṣṇa dead.
around us is the dasyu riteless void of sense inhuman keeping alien laws.
baffle thou slayer of the foe the weapon which this dāsa wields.
hero with heroes thou art ours yea strong are they whom thou dost help.
in many a place are thy full gifts and men like vassals sing thy praise.
urge thou these heroes on to slay the enemy brave thunderer in the fight with swords.
even when hid among the tribes of sages numerous as stars.
swift come those gifts of thine whose hand is prompt to rend and burn o hero thunderarmed.
as thou with thy companions didst destroy the whole of susnias brood.
let not thine excellent assistance come to us o hero indra profitless.
may we may we enjoy the bliss of these thy favours thunderer.
may those soft impulses of thine o indra be fruitful and innocent to us.
may we know these whose treasures are like those of milchkine thunderer.
that earth through power of knowing things that may be known handless and footless yet might thrive.
thou slewest turning to the right guna for every living man.
drink drink the soma hero indra be not withheld as thou art good o treasuregiver.
preserve the singers and our liberal princes and make us wealthy with abundant riches.
