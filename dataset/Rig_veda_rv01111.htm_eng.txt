working with skill they wrought the lightly rolling car they wrought the bays who bear indra and bring great gifts.
the Ṛbhus for their parents made life young again and fashioned for the calf a mother by its side.
for sacrifice make for us active vital power for skill and wisdom food with noble progeny.
grant to our company this power most excellent that with a family allheroic we may dwell.
do ye o Ṛbhus make prosperity for us prosperity for car ye heroes and for steed.
grant us prosperity victorious evermore.
conquering foes in battle strangers or akin.
indra the Ṛbhus lord i invocate for aid the Ṛbhus vājas maruts to the soma draught.
varuṇa mitra both yea and the aśvins twain let them speed us to wealth wisdom and victory.
may Ṛbhu send prosperity for battle may vāja conquering in the fight protect us.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
