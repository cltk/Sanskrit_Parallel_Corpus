come hither maruts on your lightning laden cars sounding with sweet songs armed with lances winged with steeds.
fly unto us with noblest food like birds o ye of mighty power.
with their redhued or haply tawny coursers which speed their chariots on they come for glory.
brilliant like gold is he who holds the thunder earth have they smitten with the chariots felly.
for beauty ye have swords upon your bodies as they stir woods so may they stir our spirits.
for your sake o ye maruts very mighty and wellborn have they set the stone in motion.
the days went round you and came back o yearners back to this prayer and to this solemn worship.
the gotamas making their prayer with singing have pushed the wells lid up to drink the water.
no hymn way ever known like this aforetime which gotama sang forth for you o maruts.
what time upon your golden wheels he saw you wild boars rushing about with tusks of iron.
to you this freshening draught of soma rusheth o maruts like the voice of one who prayeth.
it rusheth freely from our hands as these libations wont to flow.
