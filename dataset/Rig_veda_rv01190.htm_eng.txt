glorify thou bṛhaspati the scatheless who must be praised with hymns sweettongued and mighty.
to whom as leader of the song resplendent worthy of lauds both gods and mortals listen.
on him wait songs according to the season even as a stream of pious men set moving.
bṛhaspatifor he laid out the expanseswas at the sacrifice vast mātariśvan.
the praise the verse that offers adoration may he bring forth as the sun sends his arms out.
he who gives daily light through this gods wisdom strong as a dread wild beast and inoffensive.
his song of praise pervades the earth and heaven let the wise worshipper draw it like a courser.
these of bṛhaspati like hunters arrows go to the skies that change their hue like serpents.
those god who count thee as a worthless bullock and wealthy sinners live on thee the bounteous.
on fools like these no blessing thou bestowest bṛhaspati thou punishest the spiteful.
like a fair path is he where grass is pleasant though hard to win a friend beloved most early.
those who unharmed by enemies behold us while they would make them bare stood closely compassed.
he to whom songs of praise go forth like torrents as rivers eddying under banks flow seaward.
bṛhaspati the wise the eager closely looks upon both the waters and the vessel.
so hath bṛhaspati great strong and mighty the god exceeding powerful been brought hither.
may he thus lauded give us kine and horses may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
