o brĀhmaṆaspati make him who presses soma glorious.
even kakṣīvān auśija.
the rich the healer of disease who giveth wealth increaseth store.
the promptmay he be with us still.
let not the foemans curse let not a mortals onslaught fall on us.
preserve us brahmaṇaspati.
neer is the mortal hero harmed whom indra brahmaṇaspati.
and soma graciously inspire.
do thou o brahmaṇaspati and indra soma dakṣiṇā.
preserve that mortal from distress.
to the assemblys wondrous lord to indras lovely friend who gives.
wisdom have i drawn near in prayer.
he without whom no sacrifice een of the wise man prospers he.
stirs up the series of thoughts.
he makes the oblation prosper he promotes the course of sacrifice.
our voice of praise goes to the gods.
i have seen narāśaṁsa him most resolute most widely famed.
as twere the household priest of heaven.
