in whose wild joy thou madest once Śambara divodāsas prey.
this soma is pressed out for thee o indra drink.
whose gladdening draught shed from the points thou guardest in the midst and end.
this soma is pressed out for thee o indra drink.
in whose wild joy thou settest free the kine held fast within the rock.
this soma is pressed out for thee o indra drink.
this in whose juice delighting thou gainest the might of maghavan.
this soma is pressed out for thee o indra drink.
