his honouring rite whose grass is trimmed is offered swiftly to you in manus wise accordant.
the rite which indravaruṇa shall carry this day to high success and glorious issue.
for at gods worship they are best through vigour they have become the strongest of the heroes.
with mighty strength most liberal of the princes chiefs of the host by law made vṛtras slayers.
praise those twain gods for powers that merit worship indra and varuṇa for bliss the joyous.
one with his might and thunderbolt slays vṛtra the other as a sage stands near in troubles.
though dames and men have waxen strong and mighty and all the gods selfpraised among the heroes.
ye indravaruṇa have in might surpassed them and thus were ye spread wide o earth and heaven.
righteous is he and liberal and helpful who indravaruṇa brings you gifts with gladness.
that bounteous man through food shall conquer faemen and win him opulence and wealthy people.
may wealth which ye bestow in food and treasure on him who brings you gifts and sacrifices.
wealth gods which breaks the curse of those who vex us be indravaruṇa een our own possession.
so also indravaruṇa may our princes have riches swift to save with gods to guard them.
they whose great might gives victory in battles and their triumphant glory spreads with swiftness.
indra and varuṇa gods whom we are lauding mingle ye wealth with our heroic glory.
may we who praise the strength of what is mighty pass dangers as with boats we cross the waters.
now will i sing a dear and farextending hymn to varuṇa the god sublime imperial lord.
who mighty governor eternal as with flame illumines both wide worlds with majesty and power.
true to law indravaruṇa drinkers of the juice drink this pressed soma which shall give you rapturous joy.
your chariot cometh to the banquet of the gods to sacrifice as it were home that ye may drink.
indra and varuṇa drink your fill ye heroes of this invigorating sweetest soma.
this juice is shed by us that ye may quaff it on this trimmed grass be seated and rejoice you.
