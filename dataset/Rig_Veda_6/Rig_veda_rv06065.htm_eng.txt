shedding her light on human habitations this child of heaven hath called us from our slumber.
she who at nighttime with her argent lustre hath shown herself een through the shades of darkness.
all this with redrayed steeds have they divided the dawns on bright cars shine in wondrous fashion.
they bringing near the stately rites commencement drive far away the nights surrounding shadows.
dawns bringing hither to the man who worships glory and power and might and food and vigour.
opulent with imperial sway like heroes favour your servant and this day enrich him.
now is there treasure for the man who serves you now for the hero dawns who brings oblation.
now for the singer when he sings the praisesong even to one like me ye brought aforetime.
o dawn who standest on the mountain ridges aṅgirases now praise thy stalls of cattle.
with prayer and holy hymn they burst them open the heroes calling on the gods was fruitful.
shine on us as of old thou child of heavenon him rich maid who serves like bharadvāja.
give to the singer wealth with noble heroes and upon us bestow widespreading glory.
