your men have followed indra for his friendship and for his lovingkindness glorified him.
for he bestows great wealth the thunderwielder worship him great and kind to win his favour.
him to whose hand men closely cling and drivers stand on his golden chariot firmly stationed.
with his firm arms he holds the reins his horses the stallions are yoked ready for the journey.
thy devotees embrace thy feet for glory bold thunderarmed rich through thy strength in guerdon.
robed in a garment fair as heaven to look on thou hast displayed thee like an active dancer.
that soma when effused hath best consistence for which the food is dressed and grain is mingled.
by which the men who pray extolling indra chief favourites of gods recite their praises.
no limit of thy might hath been appointed which by its greatness sundered earth and heaven.
these the prince filleth full with strong endeavour driving as twere with help his flocks to waters.
so be the lofty indra prompt to listen helper unaided goldenvisored hero.
yea so may he shown forth in might unequalled smite down the many vṛtras and the dasyus.
