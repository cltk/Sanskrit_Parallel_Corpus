thou art attached to pressedout soma indra at laud at prayer and when the hymn is chanted.
or when with yoked bays maghavan thou comest o indra bearing in thine arms the thunder.
or when on that decisive day thou holpest the presser of the juice at vṛtras slaughter.
or when thou while the strong one feared undaunted gavest to death indra the daring dasyus.
let indra drink the pressedout soma helper and mighty guide of him who sings his praises.
he gives the hero room who pours oblations and treasure even to the lowly singer.
een humble rites with his bay steeds he visits he wields the bolt drinks soma gives us cattle.
he makes the valiant rich in store of heroes accepts our praise and hears the singers calling.
what he hath longed for we have brought to indra who from the days of old hath done us service.
while soma flows we will sing hymn and laud him so that our prayer may streng then indras vigour.
thou hast made prayer the means of thine exalting therefore we wait on thee with hymns o indra.
may we by the pressed soma somadrinker bring thee with sacrifice blissful sweet refreshment.
mark well our sacrificial cake delighted indra drink soma and the milk commingled.
here on the sacrificers grass be seated give ample room to thy devoted servant.
o mighty one be joyful as thou willest let these our sacrifices reach and find thee.
and may this hymn and these our invocations turn thee whom many men invoke to help us.
friends when thejuices flow replenish duly your own your bounteous indra with the soma.
will it not aid him to support us indra spares him who sheds the juice to win his favour.
while soma flowed thus indra hath been lauded ruler of nobles mid the bharadvājas.
that indra may become the singers patron and give him wealth in every kind of treasure.
