i laud the heroes twain this heavens controllers singing with songs of praise i call the aśvins.
fain in a moment when the morns are breaking to part the earths ends and the spacious regions.
moving to sacrifice through realms of lustre they light the radiance of the car that bears them.
traversing many wide unmeasured spaces over the wastes ye pass and fields and waters.
ye to that bounteous path of yours ye mighty have ever borne away our thoughts with horses.
mindswift and full of vigour that the trouble of man who offers gifts might cease and slumber.
so ye when ye have yoked your chariothorses come to the hymn of the most recent singer.
our true and ancient herald priest shall bring you the youthful bearing splendour food and vigour.
with newest hymn i call those wonderworkers ancient and brilliant and exceeding mighty.
bringers of bliss to him who lauds and praises bestowing varied bounties on the singer.
so ye with birds out of the sea and waters bore bhujyu son of tugra through the regions.
speeding with winged steeds through dustless spaces out of the bosom of the flood they bore him.
victors carborne ye rent the rock asunder bulls heard the calling of the eunuchs consort.
bounteous ye filled the cow with milk for Śayu thus swift and zealous ones ye showed your favour.
whateer from olden time heaven earth existeth great object of the wrath of gods and mortals.
make that Ādityas vasus sons of rudra an evil brand to one allied with demons.
may he who knows as varuṇa and mitra airs realm appointing both the kings in season.
against the secret fiend cast forth his weapon against the lying words that strangers utter.
come to our home with friendly wheels for offipring come on your radiant chariot rich in heroes.
strike off ye twain the heads of our assailants who with mans treacherous attack approach us.
come hitherward to us with teams of horses the highest and the midmost and the lowest.
bountiful lords throw open to the singer doors een of the firmclosed stall of cattle.
