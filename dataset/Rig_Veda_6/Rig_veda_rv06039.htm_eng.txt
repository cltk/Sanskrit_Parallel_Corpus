of this our charming our celestial soma eloquent wise priest with inspired devotion.
of this thy close attendant hast thou drunken god send the singer food with milk to grace it.
craving the kine rushing against the mountain led on by law with holyminded comrades.
he broke the neverbroken ridge of vala with words of might indra subdued the paá¹‡is.
this indu lighted darksome nights o indra throughout the years at morning and at evening.
him have they stablished as the days bright ensign he made the mornings to be born in splendour.
he shone and caused to shme the worlds that shone not by law he lighted up the host of mornings.
he moves with steeds yoked by eternal order contenting men with nave that finds the sunlight.
now praised o ancient king fill thou the singer with plenteous food that he may deal forth treasures.
give waters herbs that have no poison forests and kine and steeds and men to him who lauds thee.
