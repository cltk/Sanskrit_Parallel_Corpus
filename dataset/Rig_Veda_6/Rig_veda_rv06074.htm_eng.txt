hold fast your godlike sway o somarudra let these our sacrifices quickly reach you.
placing in every house your seven great treasures bring blessing to our quadrupeds and bipeds.
soma and rudra chase to every quarter the sickness that hath visited our dwelling.
drive nirrti away into the distance and give us excellent and happy glories.
provide o somarudra for our bodies all needful medicines to heal and cure us.
set free and draw away the sin committed which we have still inherent in our persons.
armed with keen shafts and weapons kind and loving be gracious unto us soma and rudra.
release us from the noose of varuá¹‡a keep us from sorrow in your tender lovingkindness.
