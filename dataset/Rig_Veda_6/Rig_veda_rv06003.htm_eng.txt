true guardian of the law thy faithful servant wins ample light and dwells in peace o agni.
whom thou as varuṇa in accord with mitra guardest o god by banishing his trouble.
he hath paid sacrifices toiled in worship and offered gifts to wealthincreasing agni.
him the displeasure of the famous moves not outrage and scorn affect not such a mortal.
bright god whose look is free from stain like sūryas thou swift what time thou earnestly desirest.
hast gear to give us come with joy at evening where child of wood thou mayest also tarry.
fierce is his gait and vast his wondrous body he champeth like a horse with bit and bridle.
and darting forth his tongue as twere a hatchet burning the woods smelteth them like a smelter.
archerlike fain toshoot he sets his arrow and whets his splendour like the edge of iron.
the messenger of night with brilliant pathway like a treeroosting bird of rapid pinion.
in beams of morn he clothes him like the singer and bright as mitra with his splendour crackles.
red in the night by day the mens possession red he belongs to men by day immortal.
like heavens when scattering beams his voice was uttered among the plants the radiant hero shouted.
who with his glow in rapid course came hither to fill both worlds wellwedded dames with treasure.
who with supporting streams and rays that suit him hath flashed like lightning with his native vigour.
like the deft maker of the band of maruts the bright impetuous one hath shone refulgent.
