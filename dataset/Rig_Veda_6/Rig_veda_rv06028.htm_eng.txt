the kine have come and brought good fortune let them rest in the cowpen and be happy near us.
here let them stay prolific manycoloured and yield through many morns their milk for indra.
indra aids him who offers sacrifice and gifts he takes not what is his and gives him more thereto.
increasing ever more and ever more his wealth he makes the pious dwell within unbroken bounds.
these are neer lost no robber ever injures them no evilminded foe attempts to harass them.
the master of the kine lives many a year with these the cows whereby he pours his gifts and serves the gods.
the charger with his dusty brow oertakes them not and never to the shambles do they take their way.
these cows the cattle of the pious worshipper roam over widespread pasture where no danger is.
to me the cows seem bhaga they seem indra they seem a portion of the firstpoured soma.
these present cows they o ye indra i long for indra with my heart and spirit.
o cows ye fatten een the worn and wasted and make the unlovely beautiful tolook on.
prosper my house ye with auspicious voices your power is glorified in our assemblies.
crop goodly pasturage and be prolific drink pure sweet water at good drinking places.
never be thief or sinful man your matter and may the dart of rudra still avoid you.
now let this close admixture be close intermigled with these cows.
mixt with the steers prolific flow and indra with thy hero might.
