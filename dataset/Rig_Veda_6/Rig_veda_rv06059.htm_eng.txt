i will declare while juices flow the manly deeds that ye have done.
your fathers enemies of gods were smitten down and indraagni ye survive.
thus indraagnip verily your greatness merits loftiest praise.
sprung from one common father brothers twins are ye your mother is in every place.
these who delight in flowing juice like fellow horses at their food.
indra and agni gods armed with the thunderbolt we call this day to come with help.
indra and agni friends of law served with rich gifts your speech is kind.
to him who praises you while these libations flow that man o gods ye neer consume.
what mortal understands o gods indra and agni this your way.
one of you yoking steeds that move to every side advances in your common car.
first indraagni hath this maid come footless unto those with feet.
stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue she hath gone downward thirty steps.
een now o indraagni men hold in their arms and stretch their bows.
desert us not in this great fray in battles for the sake of kine.
the foemans sinful enmities indra and agni vex me sore.
drive those who hate me far away and keep them distant from the sun.
indra and agni yours are all the treasures of the heavens and earth.
here give ye us the opulence that prospers every living man.
o indraagni who accept the laud and hear us for our praise.
come near us drawn by all our songs to drink of this our soma juice.
