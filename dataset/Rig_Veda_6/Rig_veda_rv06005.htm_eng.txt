i invocate your son of strength the youthful with hymns the youngest god whose speech is guileless.
sage who sends wealth comprising every treasure bringer of many boons devoid of malice.
at eve and morn thy pious servants bring thee their precious gifts o priest of many aspects.
on whom the purifier all things living as on firm ground their happiness have stablished.
