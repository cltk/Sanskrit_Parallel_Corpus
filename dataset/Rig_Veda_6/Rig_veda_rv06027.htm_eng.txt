what deed hath indra done in the wild transport in quaffing or in friendship with the soma.
what joys have men of ancient times or recent obtained within the chamber of libation.
in its wild joy indra hath proved him faithful faithful in quaffing faithful in its friendship.
his truth is the delight that in this chamber the men of old and recent times have tasted.
all thy vast power o maghavan we know not know not the riches of thy full abundance.
no one hath seen that might of thine productive of bounty every day renewed o indra.
this one great power of thine our eyes have witnessed wherewith thou slewest varasikhas children.
when by the force of thy descending thunder at the mere solund their boldest was demolished.
in aid of abhyavartin cayamana indra destroyed the seed of varasikha.
at hariyupiya he smote the vanguard of the vrcivans and the rear fled frighted.
three thousand mailed in quest of fame together on the yavyavati o muchsought indra.
vrcivans sons falling before the arrow like bursting vessels went to their destruction.
he whose two red steers seeking goodly pasture plying their tongues move on twixt earth and heaven.
gave turvaśa to sṛñjaya and to aid him gave the vrcivans up to daivavata.
two wagonteams with damsels twenty oxen o agni abhydvartin cayamdna.
the liberal sovran giveth me this guerdon of prthus seed is hard to win from others.
