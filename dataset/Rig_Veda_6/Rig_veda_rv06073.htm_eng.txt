served with oblations firstborn mountainrender aṅgiras son bṛhaspati the holy.
with twicefirm path dwelling in light our father roars loudly as a bull to earth and heaven.
bṛhaspati who made for such a people wide room and verge when gods were invocated.
slaying his enemies breaks down their castles quelling his foes and conquering those who hate him.
bṛhaspati in war hath won rich treasures hath won this god the great stalls filled with cattle.
striving to win waters and light resistless bṛhaspati with lightning smites the foeman.
