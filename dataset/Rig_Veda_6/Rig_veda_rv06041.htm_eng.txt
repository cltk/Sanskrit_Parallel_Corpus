come gracious to our sacrifice o indra pressed somadrops are purified to please thee.
as cattle seek their home so thunderwielder come indra first of those who claim our worship.
with that wellformed most wideextending palate wherewith thou ever drinkest streams of sweetness.
drink thou the adhvaryu standeth up before thee let thy spoilwinning thunderbolt attend thee.
this drop steerstrong and omniform the soma hath been made ready for the bull for india.
drink this lord of the bays thou strong supporter this that is thine of old thy food for ever.
soma when pressed excels the unpressed soma better for one who knows to give him pleasure.
come to this sacrifice of ours o victor replenish all thy powers with this libation.
we call on thee o indra come thou hither sufficient be the soma for thy body.
rejoice thee Åšatakratu in the juices guard us in wars guard us among our people.
