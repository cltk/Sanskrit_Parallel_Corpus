give us the rapture that is mightiest indra prompt to bestow and swift to aid o hero.
that wins with brave steeds where brave steeds encounter and quells the vṛtras and the foes in battle.
for with loud voice the tribes invoke thee indra to aid them in the battlefield of heroes.
thou with the singers hast pierced through the paṇis the charger whom thou aidest wins the booty.
both races indra of opposing foemen o hero both the Ārya and the dāsa.
hast thou struck down like woods with wellshot lightnings thou rentest them in fight most manly chieftain.
indra befriend us with no scanty succour prosper and aid us loved of all that liveth.
when fighting for the sunlight we invoke thee o hero in the fray in wars division.
be ours o indra now and for the future be graciously inclined and near to help us.
thus may we singing sheltered by the mighty win many cattle on the day of trial.
