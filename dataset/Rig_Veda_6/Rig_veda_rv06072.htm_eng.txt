great is this might of yours indra and soma the first high exploits were your own achievements.
ye found the sun ye found the light of heaven ye killed all darkness and the gods blasphemers.
ye indrasoma gave her light to morning and led the sun on high with all his splendour.
ye stayed the heaven with a supporting pillar and spread abroad apart the earth the mother.
ye slew the flood obstructing serpent vṛtra indra and soma heaven approved your exploit.
ye urged to speed the currents of the rivers and many seas have ye filled full with waters.
ye in the unripe udders of the milchkine have set the ripe milk indra thou and soma.
ye have held fast the unimpeded whiteness within these manycoloured moving creatures.
verily ye bestow indra and soma wealth famed victorious passing to our children.
ye have invested men ye mighty beings with manly strength that conquers in the battle.
