bring sacrificial gifts to him omniscient for he longs to drink.
the wanderer who comes with speed the hero ever in the van.
with soma go ye nigh to him chief drinker of the somas juice.
with beakers to the impetuous god to indra with the drops effused.
what time with soma with the juice effused ye come before the god.
full wise he knows the hope of each and bold one strikes this foe and that.
to him adhvaryu yea to him give offerings of the juice expressed.
will he not keep us safely from the spiteful curse of each presumptuous highborn foe.
