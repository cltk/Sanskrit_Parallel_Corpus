sole lord of wealth art thou o lord of riches thou in thine hands hast held the people indra.
men have invoked thee with contending voices for seed and waters progeny and sunlight.
through fear of thee o indra all the regions of earth though naught may move them shake and tremble.
all that is firm is frightened at thy coming the earth the heaven the mountain and the forest.
with kutsa indra thou didst conquer Śuṣṇa voracious bane of crops in fight for cattle.
in the close fray thou rentest him thou stolest the suns wheel and didst drive away misfortunes.
thou smotest to the ground the hundred castles impregnable of Śambara the dasyu.
when strong with might thou holpest divodāsa who poured libations out o somabuyer and madest bharadvāja rich who praised thee.
as such true hero for great joy of battle mount thy terrific car o brave and manly.
come with thine help to me thou distant roamer and glorious god spread among men my glory.
