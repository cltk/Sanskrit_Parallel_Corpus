from thee as branches from a tree o agni from thee auspicious god spring all our blessings.
wealth swiftly strength in battle with our foemen the rain besought of heaven the flow of waters.
thou art our bhaga to send wealth thou dwellest like circumambient air with wondrous splendour.
friend art thou of the lofty law like mitra controller agni god of many a blessing.
agni the hero slays with might his foeman the singer bears away the paá¹‡is booty.
even he whom thou sage born in law incitest by wealth accordant with the child of waters.
the man who son of strength  with sacrifices hymns lauds attracts thy fervour to the altar.
enjoys each precious thing o god o agni gains wealth of corn and is the lord of treasures.
grant son of strength to men for their subsistence such things as bring high fame and hero children.
for thou with might givest much food in cattle even to the wicked wolf when he is hungry.
eloquent son of strength most mighty agni vouchsafe us seed and offspring full of vigour.
may i by all my songs obtain abundance may brave sons gladden us through a hundred winters.
