the priest goes forth to sacrifice with wondrous power sending aloft the hymn of glorious brilliancy.
he moves to meet the ladles turning to the right which are the first to kiss the place where he abides.
to him sang forth the flowing streams of holy law encompassed in the home and birthplace of the god.
he when he dwelt extended in the waters lap absorbed those godlike powers for which he is adored.
seeking in course altern to reach the selfsame end the two copartners strive to win this beauteous form.
like bhaga must he be duly invoked by us as he who drives the car holds fast the horses reins.
he whom the two copartners with observance tend the pair who dwell together in the same abode.
by night as in the day the grey one was born young passing untouched by eld through many an age of man.
him the ten fingers the devotions animate we mortals call on him a god to give us help.
he speeds over the sloping surface of the land new deeds hath he performed with those who gird him round.
for agni like a herdsman thou by thine own might rulest oer all that is in heaven and on the earth.
and these two mighty ones bright golden closely joined rolling them round are come unto thy sacred grass.
agni accept with joy be glad in this our prayer joygiver selfsustained strong born of holy law.
for fair to see art thou turning to every side pleasant to look on as a dwelling filled with food.
