may varuṇa with guidance straight and mitra lead us he who knows.
and aryaman in accord with gods.
for they are dealers forth of wealth and not deluded with their might.
guard evermore the holy laws.
shelter may they vouchsafe to us immortal gods to mortal men.
chasing our enemies away.
may they mark out our paths to bliss indra the maruts pūṣan.
and bhaga the gods to be adored.
yea pūṣan viṣṇu ye who run your course enrich our hymns with kine.
bless us with all prosperity.
the winds waft sweets the rivers pour sweets for the man who keeps the law.
so may the plants be sweet for us.
sweet be the night and sweet the dawns sweet the terrestrial atmosphere.
sweet be our father heaven to us.
may the tall tree be full of sweets for us and full of sweets the sun.
may our milchkine be sweet for us.
be mitra gracious unto us and varuṇa and aryaman.
indra bṛhaspati be kind and viṣṇu of the mighty stride.
