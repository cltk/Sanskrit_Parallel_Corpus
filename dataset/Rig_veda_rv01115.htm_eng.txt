the brilliant presence of the gods hath risen the eye of mitra varuṇa and agni.
the soul of all that moveth not or moveth the sun hath filled the air and earth and heaven.
like as a young man followeth a maiden so doth the sun the dawn refulgent goddess.
where pious men extend their generations before the auspicious one for happy fortune.
auspicious are the suns baycoloured horses bright changing hues meet for our shouts of triumph.
bearing our prayers the skys ridge have they mounted and in a moment speed round earth and heaven.
this is the godhead this might of sūrya he hath withdrawn what spread oer work unfinished.
when he hath loosed his horses from their station straight over all night spreadeth out her garment.
in the skys lap the sun this form assumeth that varuṇa and mitra may behold it.
his bay steeds well maintain his power eternal at one time bright and darksome at another.
this day o gods while sūrya is ascending deliver us from trouble and dishonour.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
