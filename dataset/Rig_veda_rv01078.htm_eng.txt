o jĀtavedas keen and swift we gotamas with sacred song exalt thee for thy glories sake.
thee as thou art desiring wealth gotama worships with his song.
we laud thee for thy glories sake.
as such like aṅgiras we call on thee best winner of the spoil.
we laud thee for thy glories sake.
thee best of vṛtraslayers thee who shakest off our dasyu foes.
we laud thee for thy glories sake.
a pleasant song to agni we sons of rahūgaṅa have sung.
we laud thee for thy glories sake.
