flying with falcons may your chariot aśvins most gracious bringing friendly.
help come hither.
your chariot swifter than the mind of mortal fleet as the wind threeseated o ye mighty.
come to us with your chariot triple seated threewheeled of triple form that rolleth lightly.
fill full our cows give mettle to our horses and make each hero son grow strong o aśvins.
with your wellrolling car descending swiftly hear this the pressstones song ye wonderworkers.
how then have ancient sages said o aśvins that ye most swiftly come to stay affliction.
o aśvins let your falcons bear you hither yoked to your chariot swift with flying pinions.
which ever active like the airy eagles carry you o nāsatyas to the banquet.
the youthful daughter of the sun delighting in you ascended there your chariot heroes.
borne on their swift wings let your beauteous horses your birds of ruddy hue convey you near us.
ye raised up vandana strong wonderworkers with great might and with power ye rescued rebha.
from out the sea ye saved the son of tugra and gave his youth again unto cyavāna.
to atri cast down to the fire that scorched him ye gave o aśvins strengthening food and favour.
accepting his fair praises with approval ye gave his eyes again to blinded kaṇva.
for ancient Śayu in his sore affliction ye caused his cow to swell with milk o aśvins.
the quail from her great misery ye delivered and a new leg for viśpalā provided.
a white horse aśvins ye bestowed on pedu a serpentslaying steed sent down by indra.
loudneighing conquering the foe highmettled firmlimbed and vigorous winning thousand treasures.
such as ye are o nobly born o heroes we in our trouble call on you for succour.
accepting these our songs for our wellbeing come to us on your chariot treasureladen.
come unto us combined in love nāsatyas come with the fresh swift vigour of the falcon.
bearing oblations i invoke you aśvins at the first break of everlasting morning.
