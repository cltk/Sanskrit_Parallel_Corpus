glad thee thy glory hath been quaffed lord of bay steeds as twere the bowls enlivening mead.
for thee the strong there is strong drink mighty omnipotent to win.
let our strong drink most excellent exhilarating come to thee.
victorious indra bringing gain immortal conquering in fight.
thou hero winner of the spoil urgest to speed the car of man.
burn like a vessel with the flame the lawless dasyu conqueror.
empowered by thine own might o sage thou stolest sūryas chariot wheel.
thou barest kutsa with the steeds of wind to Śuṣṇa as his death.
most mighty is thy rapturous joy most splendid is thine active power.
wherewith foeslaying sending bliss thou art supreme in gaining steeds.
as thou o indra to the ancient singers wast ever joy as water to the thirsty.
so unto thee i sing this invocation may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
