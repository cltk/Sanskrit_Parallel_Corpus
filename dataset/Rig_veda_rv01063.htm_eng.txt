thou art the mighty one when born o indra with power thou terrifiedst earth and heaven.
when in their fear of thee all firmset mountains and monstrous creatures shook like dust before thee.
when thy two wandering bays thou drawest hither thy praiser laid within thine arms the thunder.
wherewith o muchinvoked in will resistless thou smitest foemen down and many a castle.
faithful art thou these thou defiest indra thou art the Ṛbhus lord heroic victor.
thou by his side for young and glorious kutsa with steed and car in battle slewest Śuṣṇa.
that as a friend thou furtheredst o indra when thunderer strong in act thou crushedst vṛtra.
when hero thou greatsouled with easy conquest didst rend the dasyus in their.
distant dwelling.
this doest thou and art not harmed o indra een in the anger of the strongest mortal.
lay thou the racecourse open for our horses as with a club slay thunderarmed our foemen.
hence men invoke thee indra in the tumult of battle in the lightbestowing conflict.
this aid of thine o godlike one was ever to be implored in deeds of might in combat.
warring for purukutsa thou o indra thunderarmed breakest down the seven castles.
easily for sudās like grass didst rend them and out of need king broughtest gain to pūru.
o indra god who movest round about us feed us with varied food plenteous as water.
food wherewithal o hero thou bestowest vigour itself to flow to us for ever.
prayers have been made by gotamas o indra addressed to thee with laud for thy bay horses.
bring us in noble shape abundant riches may he enriched with prayer come soon and early.
