o brahmaṆaspati stand up godserving men we pray to thee.
may they who give good gifts the maruts come to us indra most swift be thou with them.
o son of strength each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him.
o maruts may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might.
may brahmaṇaspati draw nigh may sūnṛtā the goddess come.
and gods bring to this rite which gives the fivefold gift the hero lover of mankind.
he who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never shall decay.
for him we offer sacred herogiving food peerless and conquering easily.
now brahmaṇaspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise.
wherein indra and varuṇa mitra aryaman the gods have made their dwelling place.
may we in holy synods gods recite that hymn peerless that brings felicity.
if you o heroes graciously accept this word may it obtain all bliss from you.
who shall approach the pious who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed.
the offerer with his folk advances more and more he fills his house with precious things.
he amplifies his lordly might with kings he slays een mid alarms he dwells secure.
in great or lesser fight none checks him none subduesthe wielder of the thunderbolt.
