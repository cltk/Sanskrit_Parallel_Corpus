a thousand are thy helps for us o indra a thousand lord of bays thy choice refreshments.
wealth of a thousand sorts hast thou to cheer us may precious goods come nigh to us in thousands.
may the most sapient maruts with protection with best boons brought from lofty heaven approach us.
now when their team of the most noble horses speeds even on the seas extremest limit.
close to them clings one moving in seclusion like a mans wife like a spear carried rearward.
well grasped bright decked with gold there is vāk also like to a courtly eloquent dame among them.
far off the brilliant neverweary maruts cling to the young maid as a joint possession.
the fierce gods drave not rodasī before them but wished for her to grow their friend and fellow.
when chose immortal rodasī to followshe with loose tresses and heroic spirit.
she climbed her servants chariot she like sūrya with cloudlike motion and refulgent aspect.
upon their car the young men set the maiden wedded to glory mighty in assemblies.
when your song maruts rose and with oblation the somapourer sang his hymn in worship.
i will declare the greatness of these maruts their real greatness worthy to be lauded.
how with them she though firm strongminded haughty travels to women happy in their fortune.
mitra and varuṇa they guard from censure aryaman too discovers worthless sinners firm things are overthrown that neer were shaken he prospers maruts who gives choice oblations.
none of us maruts near or at a distance hath ever reached the limit of your vigour.
they in courageous might still waxing boldly have compassed round their foemen like an ocean.
may we this day be dearest friends of indra and let us call on him in fight tomorrow.
so were we erst new might attend us daily so be with us Ṛbhukṣan of the heroes.
may this your laud may this your song o maruts sung by the poet mānas son māndārya.
bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
