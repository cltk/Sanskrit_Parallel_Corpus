he in midairs expanse hath golden tresses a raging serpent like the rushing tempest.
purely refulgent knowing well the morning like honourable dames true active workers.
thy wellwinged flashes strengthen in their manner when the black bull hath bellowed round about us.
with drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh the waters fall the clouds utter their thunder.
when he comes streaming with the milk of worship conducting by directest paths of order.
aryaman mitra varuṇa parijman fill the hide full where lies the nether pressstone.
o agni thou who art the lord of wealth in kine thou son of strength.
vouchsafe to us o jātavedas high renown.
he agni kindled good and wise must be exalted in our song.
shine thou of many forms shine radiantly on us.
o agni shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks.
burn thou whose teeth are sharp against the rākṣasas.
adorable in all our rites favour us agni with thine aid.
when the great hymn is chanted forth.
bring to us everconquering wealth wealth agni worthy of our choice.
in all our frays invincible.
give us o agni through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our life.
thy favour so that we may live.
o gotama desiring bliss present thy songs composed with care.
to agni of the pointed flames.
may the man fall o agni who near or afar assaileth us.
do thou increase and prosper us.
keen and swift agni thousandeyed chaseth the rākṣasas afar.
he singeth herald meet for lauds.
