what now when will ye take us by both hands as a dear sire his son.
gods for whom sacred grass is clipped.
now whither to what goal of yours go ye in heaven and not on earth.
where do your cows disport themselves.
where are your newest favours shown where maruts your prosperity.
where all your high felicities.
if o ye maruts ye the sons whom pṛśni bore were mortal and.
immortal he who sings your praise.
then never were your praiser loathed like a wild beast in pastureland.
nor should he go on yamas path.
let not destructive plague on plague hard to be conquered strike its down.
let each with drought depart from us.
truly they the fierce and mighty sons of rudra send their windless.
rain een on the desert places.
like a cow the lightning lows and follows motherlike her youngling.
when their rainflood hath been loosened.
when they inundate the earth they spread forth darkness een in day time.
with the waterladen raincloud.
o maruts at your voices sound this earthly habitation shakes.
and each man reels who dwells therein.
o maruts with your stronghoofed steeds unhindered in their courses haste.
along the bright embanked streams.
firm be the fellies of your wheels steady your horses and your cars.
and may your reins be fashioned well.
invite thou hither with this song for praise agni the lord of prayer.
him who is fair as mitra is.
form in thy mouth the hymn of praise expand thee like a rainy cloud.
sing forth the measured eulogy.
sing glory to the marut host praiseworthy tuneful vigorous.
here let the strong ones dwell with us.
