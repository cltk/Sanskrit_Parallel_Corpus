o indra drink the soma juice with Ṛtu let the cheering drops.
sink deep within which settle there.
drink from the purifiers cup maruts with Ṛtu sanctify.
the rite for ye give precious gifts.
o neṣṭar with thy dame accept our sacrifice with Ṛtu drink.
for thou art he who giveth wealth.
bring the gods agni in the three appointed places set them down.
surround them and with Ṛtu drink.
drink soma after the Ṛtus from the brāhmaṇas bounty undissolved.
o indra is thy friendships bond.
mitra varuṇa ye whose ways are firma power that none deceives.
with Ṛtu ye have reached the rite.
the somapressers fain for wealth praise the wealthgiver in the rite.
in sacrifices praise the god.
may the wealthgiver grant to us riches that shall be far renowned.
these things we gain among the gods.
he with the Ṛtu fain would drink wealthgiver from the neṣṭars bowl.
haste give your offering and depart.
as we this fourth time wealthgiver honour thee with the Ṛtus be.
a giver bountiful to us.
drink ye the meath o aśvins bright with flames whose acts are pure who with.
Ṛtus accept the sacrifice.
with Ṛtu through the housefire thou kind giver guidest sacrifice.
worship the gods for the pious man.
