they who stand round him as he moves harness the bright the ruddy steed.
the lights are shining in the sky.
on both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him.
bold tawny bearers of the chief.
thou making light where no light was and form o men where form was not.
wast born together with the dawns.
thereafter they as is their wont threw off the state of babes unborn.
assuming sacrificial names.
thou indra with the tempestgods the breakers down of what is firm.
foundest the kine even in the cave.
worshipping even as they list singers laud him who findeth wealth.
the farrenowned the mighty one.
mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless indras side.
both joyous equal in your sheen.
with indras well beloved hosts the blameless hastening to heaven.
the sacrificer cries aloud.
come from this place o wanderer or downward from the light of heaven.
our songs of praise all yearn for this.
indra we seek to give us help from here from heaven above the earth.
or from the spacious firmament.
