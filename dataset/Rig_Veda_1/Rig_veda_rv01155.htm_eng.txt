to the great hero him who sets his mind thereon and viṣṇu praise aloud in song your draught of juice.
gods neer beguiled who borne as twere by noble steed have stood upon the lofty ridges of the hills.
your somadrinker keeps afar your furious rush indra and viṣṇu when ye come with all your might.
that which hath been directed well at mortal man bowarmed kṛśānus arrow ye turn far aside.
these offerings increase his mighty manly strength he brings both parents down to share the genial flow.
he lowers though a son the fathers highest name the third is that which is high in the light of heaven.
we laud this manly power of him the mighty one preserver inoffensive bounteous and benign.
his who strode widely pacing with three steppings forth over the realms of earth for freedom and for life.
a mortal man when he beholds two steps of him who looks upon the light is restless with amaze.
but his third step doth no one venture to approach no nor the feathered birds of air who fly with wings.
he like a rounded wheel hath in swift motion set his ninety racing steeds together with the four.
developed vast in form with those who sing forth praise a youth no more a child he cometh to our call.
