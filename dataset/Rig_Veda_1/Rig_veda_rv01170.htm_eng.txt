naught is today tomorrow naught who comprehends the mystery.
we must address ourselves unto anothers thought and lost is then the hope we formed.
the maruts are thy brothers why o indra wouldst thou take our lives.
agree with them in friendly wise and do not slay us in the fight.
agastya brother why dost thou neglect us thou who art our friend.
we know the nature of thy mind verity thou wilt give us naught.
let them prepare the altar let them kindle fire in front we two.
here will spread sacrifice for thee that the immortal may observe.
thou lord of wealth art master of all treasures thou lord of friends art thy friends best supporter.
o indra speak thou kindly with the maruts and taste oblations in their proper season.
