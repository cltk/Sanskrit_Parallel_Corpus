loud singers never humbled active full of strength immovable impetuous manliest bestbeloved.
they have displayed themselves with glittering ornaments a few in number only like the heavens with stars.
when maruts on the steeps ye pile the moving cloud ye are like birds on whatsoever path it be.
clouds everywhere shed forth the rain upon your cars drop fatness honeyhued for him who sings your praise.
earth at their racings trembles as if weak and worn when on their ways they yoke their cars for victory.
they sportive loudly roaring armed with glittering spears shakers of all themselves admire their mightiness.
selfmoving is that youthful band with spotted steeds thus it hath lordly sway endued with power and might.
truthful art thou and blameless searcher out of sin so thou strong host wilt be protector of this prayer.
we speak by our descent from our primeval sire our tongue when we behold the soma stirs itself.
when shouting they had joined indra in toil of fight then only they obtained their sacrificial names.
splendours they gained for glory they who wear bright rings rays they obtained and men to celebrate their praise.
armed with their swords impetuous and fearing naught they have possessed the marutsÂ’ own beloved home.
