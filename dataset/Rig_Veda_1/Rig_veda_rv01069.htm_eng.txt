bright splendid like dawns lover he hath filled the two joined worlds as with the light of heaven.
when born with might thou hast encompassed them father of gods and yet their son wast thou.
agni the sage the humble who discerns like the cows udder the sweet taste of food.
like a blissgiver to be drawn to men sits gracious in the middle of the house.
born in the dwelling like a lovely son pleased like a strong steed he bears on the folk.
what time the men and i with heroes call may agni then gain all through godlike power.
none breaks these holy laws of thine when thou hast granted audience to these chieftains here.
this is thy boast thou smotest with thy peers and joined with heroes dravest off disgrace.
like the dawns lover spreading light wellknown as hued like morn may he remember me.
they bearing of themselves unbar the doors they all ascend to the fair place of heaven.
