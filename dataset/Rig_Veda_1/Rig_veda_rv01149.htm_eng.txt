hither he hastens to give lord of great riches king of the mighty to the place of treasure.
the pressingstones shall serve him speeding near us.
as steer of men so steer of earth and heaven by glory he whose streams all life hath drunken.
who hasting forward rests upon the altar.
he who hath lighted up the joyous castle wise courser like the steed of cloudy heaven.
bright like the sun with hundredfold existence.
he doubly born hath spread in his effulgence through the three luminous realms through all the regions.
best sacrificing priest where waters gather.
priest doubly born he through his love of glory hath in his keeping all things worth the choosing.
the man who brings him gifts hath noble offspring.
