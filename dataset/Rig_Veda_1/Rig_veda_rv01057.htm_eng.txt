to him most liberal lofty lord of lofty wealth verily powerful and strong i bring my hymn.
whose checkless bounty as of waters down a slope is spread abroad for all that live to give them strength.
now all this world for worship shall come after theethe offerers libations like floods to the depth.
when the wellloved one seems to rest upon the hill the thunderbolt of indra shatterer wrought of gold.
to him the terrible most meet for lofty praise like bright dawn now bring gifts with reverence in this rite.
whose being for renown yea indrapower and light have been created like bay steeds to move with speed.
thine indra praised by many excellently rich are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee.
lover of praise none else but thou receives our laud as earth loves all her creatures love thou this our hymn.
great is thy power o indra we are thine fulfil o maghavan the wish of this thy worshipper.
after thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength to thee and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.
thou who hast thunder for thy weapon with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud.
thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow thou hast thine own for ever all victorious might.
