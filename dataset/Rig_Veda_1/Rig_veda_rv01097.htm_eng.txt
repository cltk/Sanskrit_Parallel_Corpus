chasing with light our sin away o agni shine thou wealth on us.
may his light chase our sin away.
for goodly fields for pleasant homes for wealth we sacrifice to thee.
may his light chase our sin away.
best praiser of all these be he foremost our chiefs who sacrifice.
may his light chase our sin away.
so that thy worshippers and we thine agni in our sons may live.
may his light chase our sin away.
as everconquering agnis beams of splendour go to every side.
may his light chase our sin away.
to every side thy face is turned thou art triumphant everywhere.
may his light chase our sin away.
o thou whose face looks every way bear us past foes as in a ship.
may his light chase our sin away.
as in a ship convey thou us for our advantage oÂ’er the flood.
may his light chase our sin away.
