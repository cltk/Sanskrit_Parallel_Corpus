urge us not maghavan to this distressful fight for none may comprehend the limit of thy strength.
thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar did not men run in crowds together in their fear.
sing hymns of praise to Śakra lord of power and might laud thou and magnify indra who heareth thee.
who with his daring might a bull exceeding strong in strength maketh him master of the heaven and earth.
sing forth to lofty dyaus a strengthbestowing song the bold whose resolute mind hath independent sway.
high glory hath the asura compact of strength drawn on by two bay steeds a bull a car is he.
the ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake thou daring of thyself smotest through Śambara.
when bold with gladdening juice thou warredst with thy bolt sharp and twoedged against the banded sorcerers.
when with a roar that fills the woods thou forcest down on winds head the stores which Śuṣṇa kept confined.
who shall have power to stay thee firm and eagersouled from doing still this day what thou of old hast done.
thou helpest narya turvaśa and yadu and vayyas son turvīti Śatakratu.
thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the nineandninety castles.
a herolord is he king of a mighty folk who offers free oblations and promotes the law.
who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise for him flows down the abundant stream below the sky.
his power is matchless matchless is his wisdom chief through their work be some who drink the soma.
those indra who increase the lordly power the firm heroic strength of thee the giver.
therefore for thee are these abundant beakers indras drink stonepressed juices held in ladles.
quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure.
there darkness stood the vault that stayed the waters flow in vṛtras hollow side the raincloud lay concealed.
but indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed flood following after flood down steep declivities.
so give us indra blissincreasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people.
preserve our wealthy patrons save our princes vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring.
