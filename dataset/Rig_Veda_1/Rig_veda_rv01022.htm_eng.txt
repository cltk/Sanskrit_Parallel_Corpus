waken the aśvin pair who yoke their car at early morn may they.
approach to drink this soma juice.
we call the aśvins twain the gods borne in a noble car the best.
of charioteers who reach the heavens.
dropping with honey is your whip aśvins and full of pleasantness.
sprinkle therewith the sacrifice.
as ye go thither in your car not far o aśvins is the home.
of him who offers soma juice.
for my protection i invoke the goldenhanded savitar.
he knoweth as a god the place.
that he may send us succour praise the waters offspring savitar.
fain are we for his holy ways.
we call on him distributer of wondrous bounty and of wealth.
on savitar who looks on men.
come hither friends and seat yourselves savitar to be praised by us.
giving good gifts is beautiful.
o agni hither bring to us the willing spouses of the gods.
and tvaṣṭar to the soma draught.
most youthful agni hither bring their spouses hotrā bhāratī.
varūtrī dhiṣaṇā for aid.
spouses of heroes goddesses with whole wings may they come to us.
with great protection and with aid.
indrāṇī varuṇānī and agnāyī hither i invite.
for weal to drink the soma juice.
may heaven and earth the mighty pair bedew for us our sacrifice.
and feed us full with nourishments.
their water rich with fatness there in the gandharvas steadfast place.
the singers taste through sacred songs.
thornless be thou o earth spread wide before us for a dwellingplace.
vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure.
the gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence viṣṇu strode.
through the seven regions of the earth.
through all this world strode viṣṇu thrice his foot he planted and the whole.
was gathered in his footsteps dust.
viṣṇu the guardian he whom none deceiveth made three steps thenceforth.
establishing his high decrees.
look ye on viṣṇus works whereby the friend of indra closeallied.
hath let his holy ways be seen.
the princes evermore behold that loftiest place where viṣṇu is.
laid as it were an eye in heaven.
this viṣṇus station most sublime the singers ever vigilant.
lovers of holy song light up.
