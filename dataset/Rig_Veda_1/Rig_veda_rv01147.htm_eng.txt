how agni have the radiant ones aspiring endued thee with the vigour of the living.
so that on both sides fostering seed and offspring the gods may joy in holy laws fulfilment.
mark this my speech divine one thou most youthful offered to thee by him who gives most freely.
one hates thee and another sings thy praises i thine adorer laud thy form o agni.
thy guardian rays o agni when they saw him preserved blind māmateya from affliction.
lord of all riches he preserved the pious the foes who fain would harm them did no mischief.
the sinful man who worships not o agni who offering not harms us with doubledealing.
be this in turn to him a heavy sentence may he distress himself by his revilings.
yea when a mortal knowingly o victor injures with double tongue a fellowmortal.
from him praised agni save thou him that lauds thee bring us not into trouble and affliction.
