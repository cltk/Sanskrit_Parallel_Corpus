to drink the soma agni come to our service and our songs.
with all these gods and worship them.
the kaṇvas have invoked thee they o singer sing thee songs of praise.
agni come hither with the gods.
indra vāyu bṛhaspati mitra agni pūṣan bhaga.
Ādityas and the marut host.
for you these juices are poured forth that gladden and exhilarate.
the meathdrops resting in the cup.
the sons of kaṇva fain for help adore thee having strewn the grass.
with offerings and all things prepared.
let the swift steeds who carry thee thoughtyoked and dropping holy oil.
bring the gods to the soma draught.
adored the strengtheners of law unite them agni with their dames.
make them drink meath o bright of tongue.
let them o agni who deserve worship and praise drink with thy tongue.
the meath in solemn sacrifice.
away from the suns realm of light the wise invoking priest shall bring.
all gods awaking with the dawn.
with all the gods with indra with vāyu and mitras splendours drink.
agni the pleasant soma juice.
ordained by manu as our priest thou sittest agni at each rite.
hallow thou this our sacrifice.
harness the red mares to thy car the bays o god the flaming ones.
with those bring hitherward the gods.
