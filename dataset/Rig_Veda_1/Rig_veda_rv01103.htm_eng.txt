that highest indrapower of thine is distant that which is here sages possessed aforetime.
this one is on the earth in heaven the other and both unite as flag with flag in battle.
he spread the wide earth out and firmly fixed it smote with his thunderbolt and loosed the waters.
maghavan with his puissance struck down ahi rent rauhiṇa to death and slaughtered vyaṁsa.
armed with his bolt and trusting in his prowess he wandered shattering the forts of dāsas.
cast thy dart knowing thunderer at the dasyu increase the Āryas might and glory indra.
for him who thus hath taught these human races maghavan bearing a fameworthy title.
thunderer drawing nigh to slay the dasyus hath given himself the name of son for glory.
see this abundant wealth that he possesses and put your trust in indras hero vigour.
he found the cattle and he found the horses he found the plants the forests and the waters.
to him the truly strong whose deeds are many to him the strong bull let us pour the soma.
the hero watching like a thief in ambush goes parting the possessions of the godless.
well didst thou do that hero deed o indra in waking with thy bolt the slumbering ahi.
in thee delighted dames divine rejoiced them the flying maruts and all gods were joyful.
as thou hast smitten Śuṣṇa pipru vṛtra and kuyava and Śambaras forts o indra.
this prayer of ours may varuṇa grant and mitra and aditi and sindhu earth and heaven.
