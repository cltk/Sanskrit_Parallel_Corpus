strong pūṣans majesty is lauded evermore the glory of his lordly might is never faint his song of praise is never faint.
seeking felicity i laud him nigh to help the source of bliss.
who vigorous one hath drawn to him the hearts of all drawn them the vigorous one the god.
thee then o pūṣan like a swift one on his way i urge with lauds that thou mayst make the foemen flee drive camellike our foes afar.
as i a man call thee a god giver of bliss to be my friend.
so make our loudlychanted praises glorious in battles make them glorious.
thou pūṣan in whose friendship they who sing forth praise enjoy advantage even in wisdom through thy grace in wisdom even they are advanced.
so after this most recent course we come to thee with prayers for wealth.
not stirred to anger o wideruler come to us come thou to us in every fight.
not stirred to anger come freegiver nigh to us to take this gift of ours thou who hast goats for steeds goatborne their gift who long for fame.
so wonderworker may we turn thee hither with effectual lauds.
i slight thee not o pūṣan thou resplendent one thy friendship may not be despised.
