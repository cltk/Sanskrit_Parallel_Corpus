agni thy faithful servant i call upon thee with many a gift.
as in the keeping of the great inciting god.
thou who neÂ’er movest thee to aid the indolent the godless man.
him who though wealthy never brings an offering.
splendid o singer is that man mightiest of the great in heaven.
agni may we be foremost we thy worshippers.
