let thy bay steeds bring thee the strong hither to drink the soma draught.
those indra who are bright as suns.
here are the grains bedewed with oil hither let the bay coursers bring.
indra upon his easiest car.
indra at early morn we call indra in course of sacrifice.
indra to drink the soma juice.
come hither with thy longmaned steeds o indra to he draught we pour.
we call thee when the juice is shed.
come thou to this our song of praise to the libation poured for thee.
drink of it like a stag athirst.
here are the drops of soma juice expressed on sacred grass thereof.
drink indra to increase thy might.
welcome to thee be this our hymn reaching thy heart most excellent.
then drink the soma juice expressed.
to every draught of pressedout juice indra the vṛtraslayer comes.
to drink the soma for delight.
fulfil o Śatakratu all our wish with horses and with kine.
with holy thoughts we sing thy praise.
