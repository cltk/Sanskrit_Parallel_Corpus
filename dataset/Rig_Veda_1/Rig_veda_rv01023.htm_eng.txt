strong are the somas come thou nigh these juices have been mixt with milk.
drink vāyu the presented draughts.
both deities who touch the heaven indra and vāyu we invoke.
to drink of this our soma juice.
the singers for their aid invoke indra and vāyu swift as mind.
the thousandeyed the lords of thought.
mitra and varuṇa renowned as gods of consecrated might.
we call to drink the soma juice.
those who by law uphold the law lords of the shining light of law.
mitra i call and varuṇa.
let varuṇa be our chief defence let mitra guard us with all aids.
both make us rich exceedingly.
indra by maruts girt we call to drink the soma juice may he.
sate him in union with his troop.
gods marut hosts whom indra leads distributers of pūṣans gifts.
hearken ye all unto my cry.
with conquering indra for ally strike vṛtra down ye bounteous gods.
let not the wicked master us.
we call the universal gods and maruts to the soma draught.
for passing strong are pṛśnis sons.
fierce comes the maruts thundering voice like that of conquerors when ye go.
forward to victory o men.
born of the laughing lightning may the maruts guard us everywhere.
may they be gracious unto us.
like some lost animal drive to us bright pūṣan him who bears up heaven.
resting on manycoloured grass.
pūṣan the bright has found the king concealed and hidden in a cave.
who rests on grass of many hues.
and may he duly bring to me the six bound closely through these drops.
as one who ploughs with steers brings corn.
along their paths the mothers go sisters of priestly ministrants.
mingling their sweetness with the milk.
may waters gathered near the sun and those wherewith the sun is joined.
speed forth this sacrifice of ours.
i call the waters goddesses wherein our cattle quench their thirst.
oblations to the streams be given.
amrit is in the waters in the waters there is healing balm.
be swift ye gods to give them praise.
within the waterssoma thus hath told medwell all balms that heal.
and agni he who blesseth all the waters hold all medicines.
o waters teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm.
so that i long may see the sun.
whatever sin is found in me whatever evil i have wrought.
if i have lied or falsely sworn waters remove it far from me.
the waters i this day have sought and to their moisture have we come.
o agni rich in milk come thou and with thy splendour cover me.
fill me with splendour agni give offspring and length of days the gods.
shall know me even as i am and indra with the Ṛṣis know.
