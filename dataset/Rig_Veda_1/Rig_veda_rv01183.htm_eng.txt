make ready that which passes thought in swiftness that hath three wheels and triple seat ye mighty.
whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious whereon threefold ye fly like birds with pinions.
light rolls your easy chariot faring earthward what time for food ye full of wisdom mount it.
may this song wondrous fair attend your glory ye as ye travel wait on dawn heavens daughter.
ascend your lightly rolling car approaching the worshipper who turns him to his duties.
whereon ye come unto the house to quicken man and his offspring o nāsatyas heroes.
let not the wolf let not the shewolf harm you forsake me not nor pass me by or others.
here stands your share here is your hymn ye mighty yours are these vessels full of pleasant juices.
gotama purumīlha atri bringing oblations all invoke you for protection.
like one who goes straight to the point directed ye nāsatyas to mine invocation.
we have passed oer the limit of this darkness our praise hath been bestowed on you o aśvins.
come hitherward by paths which gods have travelled may we find strengthening food in full abundance.
