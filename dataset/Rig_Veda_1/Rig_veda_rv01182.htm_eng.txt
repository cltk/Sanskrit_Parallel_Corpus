longed for most indralike mighty most marutlike most wonderful in deed carborne best charioteers.
bring your full chariot hither heaped with liquid sweet thereon ye aśvins come to him who offers gifts.

ye made for tugras son amid the waterfloods that animated ship with wings to fly withal.
whereon with goddevoted mind ye brought him forth and fled with easy flight from out the mighty surge.
four ships most welcome in the midst of ocean urged by the aśvins save the son of tugra.
him who was cast down headlong in the waters plunged in the thick inevitable darkness.
what tree was that which stood fixed in surrounding sea to which the son of tugra supplicating clung.
like twigs of which some winged creature may take hold ye aśvins bore him off safely to your renown.
welcome to you be this the hymn of praises uttered by mānas o nāsatyas heroes.
