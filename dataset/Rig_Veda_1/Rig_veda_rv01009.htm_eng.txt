come indra and delight thee with the juice at all the soma feasts.
protector mighty in thy strength.
to indra pour ye forth the juice the active gladdening juice to him.
the gladdening omnific god.
o lord of all men fair of cheek rejoice thee in the gladdening lauds.

songs have outpoured themselves to thee indra the strong the guardian lord.
and raised themselves unsatisfied.

and glorious o most splendid one.
give indra wide and lofty fame wealthy in cattle and in strength.

grant us high fame o indra grant riches bestowing thousands those.
fair fruits of earth borne home in wains.
praising with songs the praiseworthy who cometh to our aid we call.
indra the treasurelord of wealth.
to lofty indra dweller by each libation the pious man.
sings forth aloud a strengthening hymn.
