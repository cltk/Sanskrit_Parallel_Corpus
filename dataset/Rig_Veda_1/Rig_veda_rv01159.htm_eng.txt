i praise with sacrifices mighty heaven and earth at festivals the wise the strengtheners of law.
who having gods for progeny conjoined with gods through wonderworking wisdom bring forth choicest boons.
with invocations on the gracious fathers mind and on the mothers great inherent power i muse.
prolific parents they have made the world of life and for their brood all round wide immortality.
these sons of yours well skilled in work of wondrous power brought forth to life the two great mothers first of all.
to keep the truth of all that stands and all that moves ye guard the station of your son who knows no guile.
they with surpassing skill most wise have measured out the twins united in their birth and in their home.
they the refulgent sages weave within the sky yea in the depths of sea a web for ever new.
this is today the goodliest gift of savitar this thought we have when now the god is furthering us.
on us with lovingkindness heaven and earth bestow riches and various wealth and treasure hundredfold.
