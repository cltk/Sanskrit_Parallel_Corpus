accept our loudestsounding hymn food most delightful to the gods.
pouring our offerings in thy mouth.
now agni will we say to thee o wisest and best aṅgiras.
our precious muchavailing prayer.
who agni is thy kin of men who is thy worthy worshipper.
on whom dependent who art thou.
the kinsman agni of mankind their well beloved friend art thou.
a friend whom friends may supplicate.
bring to us mitra varuṇa bring the gods to mighty sacrifice.
bring them o agni to thine home.
