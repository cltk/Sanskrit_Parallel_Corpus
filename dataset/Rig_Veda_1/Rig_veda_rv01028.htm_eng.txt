there where the broadbased stone raised on high to press the juices out.
o indra drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
where like broad hips to hold the juice the platters of the press are laid.
o indra drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
there where the woman marks and leans the pestles constant rise and fall.
o indra drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
where as with reins to guide a horse they bind the churningstaff with cords.
o indra drink with eager thirst the droppings which the mortar sheds.
if of a truth in every house o mortar thou art set for work.
here give thou forth thy clearest sound loud as the drum of conquerors.
o sovran of the forest as the wind blows soft in front of thee.
mortar for indra press thou forth the soma juice that he may drink.
best strengthgivers ye stretch wide jaws o sacrificial implements.
like two bay horses champing herbs.
ye sovrans of the forest both swift with swift pressers press today.
sweet soma juice for indras drink.
take up in beakers what remains the soma on the filter pour.
and on the oxhide set the dregs.
