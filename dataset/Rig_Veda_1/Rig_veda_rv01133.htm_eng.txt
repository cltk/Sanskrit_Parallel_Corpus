with sacrifice i purge both earth and heaven i burn up great shefiends who serve not indra.
where throttled by thy hand the foes were slaughtered and in the pit of death lay pierced and mangled.
o thou who castest forth the stones crushing the sorceressesÂ’ heads.
break them with thy widespreading foot with thy widespreading mighty foot.
do thou o maghavan beat off these sorceresses daring strength.
cast them within the narrow pit within the deep and narrow pit.
of whom thou hast ere now destroyed thricefifty with thy fierce attacks.
that deed they count a glorious deed though small to thee a glorious deed.
o indra crush and bray to bits the fearful fieryweaponed fiend.
strike every demon to the ground.
tear down the mighty ones o indra hear thou us for heaven hath glowed like earth in fear o thunderarmed as dreading fierce heat thunderarmed.
most mighty mid the mighty ones thou speedest with strong bolts of death.
not slaying men unconquered hero with the brave o hero with the thriceseven brave.
the pourer of libations gains the home of wealth pouring his gift conciliates hostilities yea the hostilities of gods.
pouring he strives unchecked and strong to win him riches thousandfold.
indra gives lasting wealth to him who pours forth gifts yea wealth he gives that long shall last.
