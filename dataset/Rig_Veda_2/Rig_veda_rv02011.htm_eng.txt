hear thou my call o indra be not heedless thine may we be for thee to give us treasures.
for these presented viands seeking riches increase thy strength like streams of water flowing.
floods great and many compassed by the dragon thou badest swell and settest free o hero.
strengthened by songs of praise thou rentest piecemeal the dāsa him who deemed himself immortal.
for hero in the lauds wherein thou joyedst in hymns of praise o indra songs of rudras.
these streams in which is thy delight approach thee even as the brilliant ones draw near to vāyu.
we who add strength to thine own splendid vigour laying within thine arms the splendid thunder.
with us mayst thou o indra waxen splendid with sūrya overcome the dāsa races.
hero thou slewest in thy valour ahi concealed in depths mysterious great enchanter.
dwelling enveloped deep within the waters him who checked heaven and stayed the floods from flowing.
indra we laud thy great deeds wrought aforetime we laud thine exploits later of achievement.
we laud the bolt that in thine arms lies eager we laud thy two bay steeds heralds of sūrya.
indra thy bay steeds showing forth their vigour have sent a loud cry out that droppeth fatness.
the earth hath spread herself in all her fulness the cloud that was about to move hath rested.
down never ceasing hath the raincloud settled bellowing it hath wandered with the mothers.
swelling the roar in the far distant limits they have spread wide the blast sent forth by indra.
indra hath hurled down the magician vṛtra who lay beleaguering the mighty river.
then both the heaven and earth trembled in terror at the strong heros thunder when he bellowed.
loud roared the mighty heros bolt of thunder when he the friend of man burnt up the monster.
and having drunk his fill of flowing soma baffled the guileful dānavas devices.
drink thou o hero indra drink the soma let the joygiving juices make thee joyful.
they filling both thy flanks shall swell thy vigour the juice that satisfies hath helped indra.
singers have we become with thee o indra may we serve duly and prepare devotion.
seeking thy help we meditate thy praises may we at once enjoy thy gift of riches.
may we be thine such by thy help o indra as swell thy vigour while they seek thy favour.
give us thou god the riches that we long for most powerful with stare of noble children.
give us a friend give us an habitation indra give us the company of maruts.
and those whose minds accord with theirs the vāyus who drink the first libation of the soma.
let those enjoy in whom thou art delighted indra drink soma for thy strength and gladness.
thou hast exalted us to heaven preserver in battles through the lofty hymns that praise thee.
great verily are they o thou protector who by their songs of praise have won the blessing.
they who strew sacred grass to be thy dwelling helped by thee have got them strength o indra.
upon the great trikadruka days hero rejoicing thee o indra drink the soma.
come with bay steeds to drink of libation shaking the drops from out thy beard contented.
hero assume the might wherewith thou clavest vṛtra piecemeal the dānava aurṇavābha.
thou hast disclosed the light to light the Ārya on thy left hand o indra sank the dasyu.
may we gain wealth subduing with thy succour and with the Ārya all our foes the dasyus.
our gain was that to tṛta of our party thou gavest up tvaṣṭars son viśvarūpa.
he cast down arbuda what time his vigour was strengthened by libations poured by tṛta.
indra sent forth his whirling wheel like sūrya and aided by the aṅgirases rent vala.
now let that wealthy cow of thine o indra yield in return a boon to him who lauds thee.
give to thy praisers let not fortune fail us loud may we speak with brave men in the assembly.
