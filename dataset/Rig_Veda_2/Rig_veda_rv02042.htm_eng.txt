telling his race aloud with cries repeated he sends his voice out as his boat a steersman.
o bird be ominous of happy fortune from no side may calamity befall thee.
let not the falcon kill thee nor the eagle let not the arrowbearing archer reach thee.
still crying in the region of the fathers speak here auspicious bearing joyful tidings.
bringing good tidings bird of happy omen call thou out loudly southward of our dwellings.
so that no thief no sinner may oppress us loud may we speak with heroes in assembly.
