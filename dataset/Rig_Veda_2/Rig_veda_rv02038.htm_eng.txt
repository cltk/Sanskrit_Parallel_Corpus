uprisen is savitar this god to quicken priest who neglects not this most constant duty.
to the gods verily he gives rich treasure and blesses him who calls them to the banquet.
having gone up on high the god broadhanded spreads his arms widely forth that all may mark him.
even the waters bend them to his service even this wind rests in the circling region.
though borne by swift steeds he will yet unyoke them e’en the fleet chariot hath he stayed from going.
he hath checked e’en their haste who glide like serpents night closely followed savitars dominion.
what was spread out she weaves afresh reweaving the skilful leaves his labour halfcompleted.
he hath arisen from rest and parted seasons savitar hath approached god holyminded.
through various dwellings through entire existence spreads manifest the household light of agni.
the mother gives her son the goodliest portion and savitar hath sped to meet his summons.
he comes again unfolded fain for conquest at home was he the love of all things moving.
each man hath come leaving his evil doings after the godlike savitars commandment.
the wild beasts spread through desert places seeking their watery share which thou hast set in waters.
the woods are given to the birds these statutes of the god savitar none disobeyeth.
with utmost speed in restless haste at sunset varuṇa seeks his watery habitation.
then seeks each bird his nest each beast his lodging in due place savitar hath set each creature.
him whose high law not varuṇa nor indra not mitra aryaman nor rudra breaketh.
nor evilhearted fiends here for my welfare him i invoke god savitar with worship.
may they who strengthen bliss and thought and wisdom and the dames’ lord and narāśaṁsa aid us.
that good may come to us and wealth be gathered may we be savitar the gods beloved.
so come to us our hearts desire the bounty bestowed by thee from heaven and earth and waters.
that it be well with friends and those who praise thee and savitar with the loudlauding singer.
