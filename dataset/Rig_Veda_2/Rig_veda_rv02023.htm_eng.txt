we call thee lord and leader of the heavenly hosts the wise among the wise the famousest of all.
the king supreme of prayers o brahmaṇaspati hear us with help sit down in place of sacrifice.
bṛhaspati god immortal verily the gods have gained from thee the wise a share in holy rites.
as with great light the sun brings forth the rays of morn so thou alone art father of all sacred prayer.
when thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom thou mountest the refulgent car of sacrifice.
the awful car bṛhaspati that quells the foe slays demons cleaves the stall of kine and finds the light.
thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men distress oertakes not him who offers gifts to thee.
him who hates prayer thou punishest bṛhaspati quelling his wrath herein is thy great mightiness.
no sorrow no distress from any side no foes no creatures doubletongued have overcome the man.
thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom careful guard thou keepest brahmaṇaspati.
thou art our keeper wise preparer of our paths we for thy service sing to thee with hymns of praise.
bṛhaspati whoever lays a snare for us him may his evil fate precipitate destroy.
him too who threatens us without offence of ours the evilminded arrogant rapacious man.
him turn thou from our path away bṛhaspati give us fair access to this banquet of the gods.
thee as protector of our bodies we invoke thee saviour as the comforter who loveth us.
strike o bṛhaspati the gods revilers down and let not the unrighteous come to highest bliss.
through thee kind prosperer o brahmaṇaspati may we obtain the wealth of men which all desire.
and all our enemies who near or far away prevail against us crush and leave them destitute.
with thee as our own rich and liberal ally may we bṛhaspati gain highest power of life.
let not the guileful wicked man be lord of usstill may we prosper singing goodly hymns of praise.
strong never yielding hastening to the battlecry consumer of the foe victorious in the strife.
thou art sins true avenger brahmaṇaspati who tamest een the fierce the wildly passionate.
whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm who deeming him a man of might mid lords would slay.
let not his deadly blow reach us bṛhaspati may we humiliate the strong illdoers wrath.
the mover mid the spoil the winner of all wealth to be invoked in fight and reverently adored.
bṛhaspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain would injure us.
burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand those who have scorned thee in thy manifested might.
show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise destroy the evil speakers o bṛhaspati.
bṛhaspati that which the foe deserves not which shines among the folk effectual splendid.
that son of law i which is with might refulgentthat treasure wonderful bestow thou on us.
give us not up to those who foes in ambuscade are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease.
who cherish in their heart abandonment of gods bṛhaspati no further rest shall they obtain.
for tvaṣṭar he who knows each sacred song brought thee to life preeminent oer all the things that be.
guiltscourger guiltavenger is bṛhaspati who slays the spoiler and upholds the mighty law.
the mountain for thy glory cleft itself apart when aṅgiras thou openedst the stall of kine.
thou o bṛhaspati with indra for ally didst hurl down waterfloods which gloom had compassed round.
o brahmaṇaspati be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou our children.
all that the gods regard with love is blessed loud may we speak with heroes in assembly.
