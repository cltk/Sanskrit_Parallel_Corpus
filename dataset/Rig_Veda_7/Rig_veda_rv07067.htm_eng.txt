i with a holy heart that brings oblation will sing forth praise to meet your car ye princes.
which muchdesired hath wakened as your envoy i call you hither as a son his parents.

exhaustless be your bounty to our princes who with their wealth incite the gift of riches.
who further friendship with their noble natures combining wealth in kine with wealth in herses.
