rich in all blessings aśvins come ye hither this place on earth is called your own possession.
like a strong horse with a fair back it standeth whereon as in a lap ye seat you firmly.
this most delightful eulogy awaits you in the mans house drinkoffering hath been heated.
which bringeth you over the seas and rivers yoking astwere two wellmatched shining horses.
whatever dwellings ye possess o aśvins in fields of men or in the streams of heaven.
resting upon the summit of the mountain or bringing food to him who gives oblation.
delight yourselves ye gods in plants and waters when Ṛṣis give them and ye find they suit you.
enriching us with treasures in abundance ye have looked back to former generations.
aśvins though ye have heard them oft aforetime regard the many prayers which Ṛṣis offer.
come to the man even as his heart desireth may we enjoy your most delightful favour.
come to the sacrifice offered you nāsatyas with men oblations and prayer duly uttered.
come to vasiṣṭha as his heart desireth for unto you these holy hymns are chanted.
this is the thought this is the song o aśvins accept this hymn of ours ye steers with favour.
may these our prayers addressed to you come nigh you preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
