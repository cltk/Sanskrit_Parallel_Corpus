we with great reverence have approached the youngest who hath shone forth wellkindled in his dwelling.
with wondrous light between wide earth and heaven wellworshipped looking forth in all directions.
through his great might oercoming all misfortunes praised in the house is agni jātavedas.
may he protect us from disgrace and trouble both us who laud him and our noble patrons.
o agni thou art varuṇa and mitra vasisthas with their holy hymns exalt thee.
with thee be most abundant gain of treasure ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
