with this my reverent hymn i call agni for you the son of strength.
dear wisest envoy served with noble sacrifice immortal messenger of all.
his two red horses allsupporting let him yoke let him wellworshipped urge them fast.
then hath the sacrifice good prayers and happy end and heavenly gift of wealth to men.
the flame of him the bountiful the muchinvoked hath mounted up.
and his redcoloured smokeclouds reach and touch the sky the men are kindling agni well.
thee thee most glorious one we make our messenger bring the gods hither to the feast.
give us o son of strength all food that fcedeth man give that for which we pray to thee.
thou agni art the homesteads lord our herald at the sacrifice.
lord of all boons thou art the cleanser and a sage pay worship and enjoy the good.
give riches to the sacrificer o most wise for thou art he who granteth wealth.
inspire with zeal each priest at this our solemn rite all who are skilled in singing praise.
o agni who art worshipped well dear let our princes he to thee.
our wealthy patrons who are governors of men who part as gifts their stalls of kine.
they in whose home her hand bearing the sacred oil iḷā sits down wellsatisfied.
guard them victorious god from slander and from harm give us a refuge famed afar.
do thou a priest with pleasant tongue most wise and very near to us.
agni bring riches hither to our liberal chiefs and speed the oflering of our gifts.
they who bestow as bounty plenteous wealth of steeds moved by desire of great renown.
do thou with saving help preserve them from distress most youthful with a hundred forts.
the god who gives your wealth demands a full libation poured to him.
pour ye it forth then fill the vessel full again then doth the god pay heed to you.
him have the gods appointed priest of sacrifice oblationbearer passing wise.
agni gives wealth and valour to the worshipper to folk who offer up their gifts.
