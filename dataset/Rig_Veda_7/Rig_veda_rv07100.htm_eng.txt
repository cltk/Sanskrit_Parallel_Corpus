neer doth the man repent who seeking profit bringeth his gift to the farstriding viṣṇu.
he who adoreth him with all his spirit winneth himself so great a benefactor.
thou viṣṇu constant in thy courses gavest goodwill to all men and a hymn that lasteth.
that thou mightst move us to abundant comfort of very splendid wealth with store of horses.
three times strode forth this god in all his grandeur over this earth bright with a hundred splendours.
foremost be viṣṇu stronger than the strongest for glorious is his name who lives for ever.
over this earth with mighty step strode viṣṇu ready to give it for a home to manu.
in him the humble people trust for safety he nobly born hath made them spacious dwellings.
today i laud this name o gipivista i skilled in rules the name of thee the noble.
yea i the poor and weak praise thee the mighty who dwellest in the realm beyond this region.
what was there to be blamed in thee o viṣṇu when thou declaredst i am sipivista.
hide not this form from us nor keep it secret since thou didst wear another shape in battle.
o viṣṇu unto thee my lips cry vaṣaṭ let this mine offering sipivista please thee.
may these my songs of eulogy exalt thee preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
