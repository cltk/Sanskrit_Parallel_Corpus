varuna cut a pathway out for sūrya and led the watery floods of rivers onward.
the mares as in a race speed on in order he made great channels for the days to follow.
the wind thy breath hath sounded through the region like a wild beast that seeks his food in pastures.
within these two exalted earth and heaven o varuṇa are all the forms thou lovest.
varuṇas spies sent forth upon their errand survey the two worldhalves well formed and fashioned.
wise are they holy skilled in sacrifices the furtherers of the praisesongs of the prudent.
to me who understand hath varuṇa spoken the names borne by the cow are three times seven.
the sapient god knowing the places secret shall speak as twere to teach the race that cometh.
on him three heavens rest and are supported and the three earths are there in sixfold order.
the wise king varuṇa hath made in heaven that golden swing to cover it with glory.
like varuṇa from heaven he sinks in sindhu like a whiteshining spark a strong wild creature.
ruling in depths and meting out the region great saving power hath he this worlds controller.
before this varuṇa may we be sinless him who shows mercy even to the sinner.
while we are keeping aditis ordinances preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
