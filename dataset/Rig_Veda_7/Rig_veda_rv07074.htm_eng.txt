these morning sacrifices call you aśvins at the break of day.
for help have i invoked you rich in power and might for house by house ye visit all.
o heroes ye bestow wonderful nourishment send it to him whose songs are sweet.
accordant both of you drive your car down to us and drink the savoury soma juice.
approach ye and be near to us drink o ye aśvins of the meath.
draw forth the milk ye mighty rich in genuine wealth injure us not and come to us.
the horses that convey you in their rapid flight down to the worshippers abode.
with these your speedy coursers heroes aśvins come ye gods come wellinclined to us.
yea verily our princes seek the aśvins in pursuit of food.
these shall give lasting glory to our liberal lords and both nāsatyas shelter us.
those who have led the way like cars offending none those who are guardians of the men.
also through their own might the heroes have grown strong and dwell in safe and happy homes.
