vastospati who killest all disease and wearest every form.
be an auspicious friend to us.
when o bright son of saramā thou showest tawnyhued thy teeth.
they gleam like lances points within thy mouth when thou wouldst bite go thou to steep.
saramās son retrace thy way bark at the robber and the thief.
at indras singers barkest thou why dust thou seek to terrify us go to sleep.
be on thy guard against the boar and let the boar beware of thee.
at indras singers barkest thou why dost thou seek to terrify us go to sleep.
sleep mother let the father sleep sleep dog and master of the house.
let all the kinsmen sleep sleep all the people who are round about.
the man who sits the man who walks and whosoever looks on us.
of these we closely shut the eyes even as we closely shut this house.
the bull who hath a thousand horns who rises up from out the sea.
by him the strong and mighty one we lull and make the people sleep.
the women sleeping in the court lying without or stretched on beds.
the matrons with their odorous sweetsthese one and all we lull to sleep.
