soma unpressed neer gladdened liberal indra no juices pressed without a prayer have pleased him.
i generate a laud that shall delight him new and heroic so that he may hear us.
at every laud the soma gladdens indra pressed juices please him as each psalm is chanted.
what time the priests with one united effort call him to aid as sons invoke their father.
these deeds he did let him achieve new exploits such as the priests declare at their libations.
indra hath taken and possessed all castles like as one common husband doth his spouses.
even thus have they declared him famed is indra as conqueror sole distributer of treasures.
whose many succours come in close succession may dear delightful benefits attend us.
thus to bring help to men vasiṣṭha laudeth indra the peoples hero at libation.
bestow upon us strength and wealth in thousands preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
