may our divine and brilliant hymn go forth like a swift chariot wrought and fashioned well.
the waters listen as they flow along they know the origin of heaven and earth.
yea the broad waters swell their flood ior him of him strong heroes think amid their foes.
set ye for him the coursers to the pole like indra thunderer is the goldenarmed.
arouse you like the days to sacrifice speed gladly like a traveller on the way.
go swift to battles to the sacrifice set up a flag a hero for the folk.
up from his strength hath risen as twere a light it bears the load as earth bears living things.
agni no demon i invoke the gods by law completing it i form a hymn.
closely albout you lay your heavenly song and send your voice to where the gods abide.
varuṇa mighty with a thousand eyes beholds the paths wherein these rivers run.
he king of kings the glory of the floods oer all that liveth hath resistless sway.
may he assist us among all the tribes and make the enviers praise devoid of light.
may the foes threatening arrow pass us by may he put far from us our bodies sin.
agni oblationcater through our prayers aid us to him our dearest laud is brought.
accordant with the gods choose for our friend the waters child may he be good to us.
with lauds i sing the dragon born of floods he sits beneath the streams in middle air.
neer may the dragon of the deep harm us neer fail this faithful servants sacrifice.
to these our heroes may they grant renown may pious men march boldly on to wealth.
leading great hosts with fierce attacks of these they burn their foes as the sun burns the earth.
what time our wives draw near to us may he lefthanded tvaṣṭar give us hero sons.
may tvaṣṭar find our hymn acceptable and may aramati seeking wealth be ours.
may they who lavish gifts bestow those treasures may rodasī and varuṇānī listen.
may he with the varūtrīs be our refuge may bountiful tvaṣṭar give us store of riches.
so may rich mountains and the liberal waters so may all herbs that grow on ground and heaven.
and earth accordant with the forestsovrans and both the worldhalves round about protect us.
to this may both the wide worlds lend approval and varuṇa in heaven whose friend is indra.
may all the maruts give consent the victors that we may hold great wealth in firm possession.
may indra varuṇa mitra and agni waters herbs trees accept the praise we offer.
may we find refuge in the maruts bosom protect us evermore ye gods with blessings.
