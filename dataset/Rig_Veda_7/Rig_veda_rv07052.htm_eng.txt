may we be free from every bond Ādityas a castle among gods and men ye vasus.
winning may we win varuṇa and mitra and being may we be o earth and heaven.
may varuṇa and mitra grant this blessing our guardians shelter to our seed and offspring.
let us not suffer for anothers trespass nor do the thing that ye o vasus punish.
the everprompt aṅgirases imploring riches from savitar the god obtained them.
so may our father who is great and holy and all the gods accordant grant this favour.
