prayers have been offered up through love of glory vasiṣṭha honour indra in the battle.
he who with might extends through all existence hears words which i his faithful servant utter.
a cry was raised which reached the gods o indra a cry to them to send us strength in combat.
none among men knows his own lifes duration bear us in safety over these our troubles.
the bays the bootyseeking car i harness my prayers have reached him who accepts them gladly.
indra when he had slain resistless foemen forced with his might the two worldhalves asunder.
like barren cows moreover swelled the waters the singen sought thy holy rite o indra.
come unto us as with his team comes vāyu thou through our solemn hymns bestowest booty.
so may these gladdening draughts rejoice thee indra the mighty very bounteous to the singer.
alone among the gods thou pitiest mortals o hero make thee glad at this libation.
thus the vasisthas glorify with praises indra the powerful whose arm wields thunder.
praised may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
