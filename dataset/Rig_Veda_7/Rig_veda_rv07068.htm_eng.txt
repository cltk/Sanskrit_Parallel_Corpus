come radiant aśvins with your noble horses accept your servants hymns ye wonderworkers.
enjoy oblations which we bring to greet you.
the gladdening juices stand prepared before you come quickly and partake of mine oblation.
pass by the calling of our foe and bear us.
your chariot with a hundred aids o aśvins beareth you swift as thought across the regions.
speeding to us o ye whose wealth is sūrya.
what time this stone of yours the gods adorer upraised sounds forth for you as somapresser.
let the priest bring you fair ones through oblations.
the nourishment ye have is truly wondrous ye gave thereof a quickening store to atri.
who being dear to you receives your favour.
that gift which all may gain ye gave cyavāna when he grew old who offered you oblations.
when ye bestowed on him enduring beauty.
what time his wicked friends abandoned bhujyu o aśvins in the middle of the ocean.
your horse delivered him your faithful servant.
ye lent your aid to vrka when exhausted and listened when invoked to Śayus calling.
ye made the cow pour forth her milk like water and aśvins strengthened with your strength the barren.
with his fair hymns this singer too extols you waking with glad thoughts at the break of morning.
may the cow nourish him with milk to feed llim preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
