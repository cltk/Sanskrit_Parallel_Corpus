great art thou agni sacrifices herald not without thee are deathless gods made joyful.
come hither with all deities about thee here take thy seat the first as priest o agni.
men with oblations evermore entreat thee the swift to undertake an envoys duty.
he on whose sacred grass with gods thou sittest to him o agni are the days propitious.
three times a day in thee are shown the treasures sent for the mortal who presents oblation.
bring the gods hither like a man o agni be thou our envoy guarding us from curses.
lord of the lofty sacrifice is agni agni is lord of every gift presented.
the vasus were contented with his wisdom so the gods made him their oblationbearer.
o agni bring the gods to taste our presents with indra leading here let them be joyful.
convey this sacrifice to gods in heaven ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
