they who lay quiet for a year the brahmans who fulfil their vows.
the frogs have lifted up their voice the voice parjanya hath inspired.
what time on these as on a dry skin lying in the pools bed the floods of heaven descended.
the music of the frogs comes forth in concert like the cows lowing with their calves beside them.
when at the coming of the rains the water has poured upon them as they yearned and thirsted.
one seeks another as he talks and greets him with cries of pleasure as a son his father.
each of these twain receives the other kindly while they are revelling in the flow of waters.
when the frog moistened by the rain springs forward and green and spotty both combine their voices.
when one of these repeats the others language as he who learns the lesson of the teacher.
your every limb seems to be growing larger as ye converse with eloquence on the waters.
onc is cowbellow and goatbleat the other one frog is green and one of them is spotty.
they bear one common name and yet they vary and talking modulate the voice diversely.
as brahmans sitting round the brimful vessel talk at the somarite of atiratra.
so frogs ye gather round the pool to honour this day of all the year the first of raintime.
these brahmans with the soma juice performing their yearlong rite have lifted up their voices.
and these adhvaryus sweating with their kettles come forth and show themselves and none are hidden.
they keep the twelve months godappointed order and never do the men neglect the season.
soon as the raintime in the year returneth these who were heated kettles gain their freedom.
cowbellow and goatbleat have granted riches and green and spotty have vouchsafed us treasure.
the frogs who give us cows in hundreds lengthen our lives in this most fertilizing season.
