savitar god of all men hath sent upward his light designed for all mankind immortal.
through the gods power that eye was first created dawn hath made all the universe apparent.
i see the paths which gods are wont to travel innocuous paths made ready by the vasus.
eastward the flag of dawn hath been uplifted she hath come hither oer the tops of houses.
great is in truth the number of the mornings which were aforetime at the suns uprising.
since thou o dawn hast been beheld repairing as to thy love as one no more to leave him.
they were the gods companions at the banquet the ancient sages true to law eternal.
the fathers found the light that lay in darkness and with effectual words begat the morning.
meeting together in the same enclosure they strive not ofone mind one with another.
they never break the gods eternal statutes and injure none in rivalry with vasus.
extolling thee blest goddess the vasisthas awake at early mom with lauds implore thee.
leader of kine and queen of all that strengthens shine come as first to us o highborn morning.
she bringeth bounty and sweet charm of voices the flushing dawn is sung by the vasisthas.
giving us riches famed to distant places preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
