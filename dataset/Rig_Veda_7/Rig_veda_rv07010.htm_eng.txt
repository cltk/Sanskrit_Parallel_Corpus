he hath sent forth bright radiant and refulgent like the dawns lover his farspreading lustre.
pure in his splendour shines the golden hero our longing thoughts hath he aroused and wakened.
he like the sun hath shone while morn is breaking and priests who weave the sacrifice sing praises.
agni the god who knows their generations and visits gods most bounteous rapid envoy.
our songs and holy hymns go forth to agni seeking the god and asking him for riches.
him fair to see of goodly aspect mighty mens messenger who carries their oblations.
joined with the vasus agni bring thou indra bring hither mighty rudra with the rudras.
aditi good to all men with Ādityas bṛhaspati allbounteous with the singers.
men eagerly implore at sacrifices agni most youthful god the joyous herald.
for he is lord and ruler over riches and for gods worship an unwearied envoy.
