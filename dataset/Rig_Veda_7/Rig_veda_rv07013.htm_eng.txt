bring song and hymn to agni asuraslayer enlightener of all and thoughtbestower.
like an oblation on the grass to please him i bring this to vaiśvānara hymninspirer.
thou with thy flame o agni brightly glowing hast at thy birth filled full the earth and heaven.
tiou with thy might vaiśvānara jātavedas settest the gods free frodi the curse that bound them.
agni when born thou lookedst on all creatures like a brisk herdsman moving round his cattle.
the path to prayer vaiśvānara thou foundest ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
