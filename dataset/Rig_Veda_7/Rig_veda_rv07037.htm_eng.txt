let your bestbearing car that must be lauded neer injured bring you vājas and Ṛbhukṣans.
fill you fairhelmeted with mighty soma thricemixed at our libations to delight you.
ye who behold the light of heaven Ṛbhukṣans give our rich patrons unmolested riches.
drink heavenlynatured at our sacrifices and give us bounties for the hymns we sing you.
for thou o bounteous one art used to giving at parting treasure whether small or ample.
filled full are both thine arms with great possessions thy goodness keeps thee not from granting riches.
indra highfamed as vāja and Ṛbhukṣans thou goest working singing to the dwelling.
lord of bay steeds this day may we vasisthas offer our prayers to thee and bring oblations.
thou winnest swift advancement for thy servant through hymns lord of bay steeds which thou hast favoured.
for thee with friendly succour have we battled and when o indra wilt thou grant us riches.
to us thy priests a home as twere thou givest when indra wilt thou recognize our praises.
may thy strong steed through our ancestral worship bring food and wealth with heroes to our dwelling.
though nirrti the goddess reigneth round him autumns with food in plenty come to indra.
with three close friends to length of days he cometh he whom men let not rest at home in quiet.
promise us gifts o savitar may riches come unto us in parvatas full bounty.
may the celestial guardian still attend us preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
