agni be kindled well with proper fuel and let the grass be scattered wide about thee.
let the impatient portals be thrown open bring thou the gods impatient to come hither.
taste agni serve the gods with our oblation offer good sacrifices jātavedas.
let jātavedas pay fair sacrifices worship andgratify the gods immortal.
wise god win for us things that are allgoodly and let the prayers we pray today be fruitful.
thee even thee the son of strength o agni those gods have made the bearer of oblations.
to thee the god may we perform our worship do thou besought grant us abundant riches.
