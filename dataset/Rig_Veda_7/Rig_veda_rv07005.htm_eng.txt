bring forth your song of praise to mighty agni the speedy messenger of earth and heaven.
vaiśvānara who with those who wake hath waxen great in the lap of all the gods immortal.
sought in the heavens on earth is agni stablished leader of rivers bull of standing waters.
vaiśvānara when he hath grown in glory shines on the tribes of men with light and treasure.
for fear of thee forth fled the darkhued races scattered abroad deserting their possessions.
when glowing o vaiśvānara for pūru thou agni didst light up and rend their castles.
agni vaiśvānara both earth and heaven submit them to thy threefold jurisdiction.
refulgent in thine undecaying lustre thou hast invested both the worlds with splendour.
agni the tawny horses loudly neighing our resonant hymns that drop with oil attend thee.
lord of the tribes our charioteer of riches ensign of days vaiśvānara of mornings.
in thee o bright as mitra vasus seated the might of aduras for they loved thy spirit.
thou dravest dasyus from their home o agni and broughtest forth broad light to light the Ārya.
born in the loftiest heaven thou in a moment reachest like wind the place where gods inhabit.
thou favouring thine offspring roaredst loudly when giving life to creatures jātavedas.
send us that strength vaiśvānara send it agni that strength o jātavedas full of splendour.
wherewith allbounteous god thou pourest riches as fame widespreading on the man who offers.
agni bestow upon our chiefs and nobles that famous power that wealth which feedeth many.
accordant with the vasus and the rudras agni vaiśvānara give us sure protection.
