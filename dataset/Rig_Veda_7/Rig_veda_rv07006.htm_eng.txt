praise of the asura high imperial ruler the manly one in whom the folk shall triumph.
i laud his deeds who is as strong as indra and lauding celebrate the fortdestroyer.
sage sing food lightthey bring him from the mountain the blessed sovran of the earth and heaven.
i decorate with songs the mighty actions which agni fortdestroyer did aforetime.
the foolish faithless rudelyspeaking niggards without belief or sacrifice or worship.
far far sway hath agni chased those dasytis and in the cast hath turned the godless westward.
him who brought eastward manliest with his prowess the maids rejoicing in the western darkness.
that agni i extol the lord of riches unyielding tamer of assailing foemen.
him who brake down the walls with deadly weapons and gave the mornings to anoble husband.
young agni who with conquering strength subduing the tribes of nahus made them bring their tribute.
in whose protection all men rest by nature desiring to enjoy his gracious favour.
agni vaiśvānara in his parents bosom hath found the choicest seat in earth and heaven.
vaiśvānara the god at the suns setting hath taken to himself deephidden treasures.
agni hath taken them from earth and heaven from the sea under and the sea above us.
