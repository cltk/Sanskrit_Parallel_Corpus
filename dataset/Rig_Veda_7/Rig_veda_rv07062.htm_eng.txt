surya hath sent aloft his beams of splendour oer all the tribes of men in countless places.
together with the heaven he shines apparent formed by his makers well with power and wisdom.
so hast thou mounted up before us sūrya through these our praises with fleet dappled horses.
declare us free from all offence to mitra and varuṇa and aryaman and agni.
may holy agni varuṇa and mitra send down their riches upon us in thousands.
may they the bright ones make our praisesong perfect and when we laud them grant us all our wishes.
o undivided heaven and earth preserve us us lofty ones your nobiyborn descendants.
let us not anger varuṇa nor vāyu nor him the dearest friend of mortals mitra.
stretch forth your arms and let our lives be lengthened with fatness dew the pastures of our cattle.
ye youthful make us famed among the people hear mitravaruṇa these mine invocations.
now mitra varuṇa aryaman vouchsafe us freedom and room for us and for our children.
may we find paths all fair and good to travel preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
