as priest with solemn rites and adorations i worship heaven and earth the high and holy.
to them great parents of the gods have sages of ancient time singing assigned precedence.
with newest hymns set in the seat of order those the two parents born before all others.
come heaven and earth with the celestial people hither to us for strong is your protection.
yea heaven and earth ye hold in your possession full many a treasure for the liberal giver.
grant us that wealth which comes in free abundance preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
