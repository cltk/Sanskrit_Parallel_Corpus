let our strong hymn of praise go forth the laud of mitravaruṇa.
with homage to that highborn pair.
the two exceeding wise the sons of dakṣa whom the gods ordained.
for lordship excellently great.
such guardians of our homes and us o mitravaruṇa fulfil.
the thoughts of those who sing your praise.
so when the sun hath risen today may sinless mitra aryaman.
bhaga and savitar sendus forth.
may this our home be guarded well forward ye bounteous on the way.
who bear us safely oer distress.
and those selfreigning aditi whose statute is inviolate.
the kings who rule a vast domain.
soon as the sun hath risen to you to mitravaruṇa i sing.
and aryarnan who slays the foe.
with wealth of gold may this my song bring unmolested power and might.
and brahmans gain the sacrifice.
may we be thine god varuṇa and with our princes mitra thine.
food and heavens light will we obtain.
many are they who strengthen law suneyed with agni for their tongue.
they who direct the three great gatherings with their thoughts yea all things with surpassing might.
they who have stablished year and month and then the day night sacrifice and holy verse.
varuṇa mitra aryarnan the kings have won dominion which none else may gain.
so at the rising of the sun we think of you with hymns today.
even as varuṇa mitra aryaman deserve ye are the charioteers of law.
true to law born in law the strengtheners of law terrible haters of the false.
in their felicity which gives the best defence may we men and our princes dwell.
uprises on the slope of heaven that marvel that attracts die sight.
as swift celestial etaśa bears it away prepared for every eye to see.
lord of each single head of fixt and moving things equally through the whole expanse.
the seven sister bays bear sūrya on his car to bring us wealth and happiness.
a hundred autumns may we see that bright eye godordained arise.
a hundred autumns may we live.
infallible through your wisdom come hither resplendent varuṇa.
and mitra to the soma draught.
come as the laws of heaven ordain varuṇa mitra void of guile.
press near and drink the soma juice.
come mitra varuṇa accept heroes our sacrificial gift.
drink soma ye who strengthen law.
