ye twain who rule in heaven and earth the region clothed be your clouds in robes of oil and fatness.
may the imperial varuṇa and mitra and highborn aryaman accept our presents.
kings guards of rrtighty everlasting order come hitherward ye princes lords of rivers.
send us from heaven o varuṇa and mitra rain and sweet food ye who pour down your bounties.
may the dear god and varuṇa and mitra conduct us by the most effective pathways.
that foes may say unto sudās our chieftain may we too joy in food with gods to guard us.
him who hath wrought for you this car in spirit who makes the song rise upward and sustains it.
bedew with fatness varuṇa nd mitra ye kings make glad the pleasant dwellingplaces.
to you this laud o varuṇa and mitra is offered like bright soma juice to vāyu.
favour our songs of praise wake thought and spirit preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
