when thou o sun this day arising sinless shalt speak the truth to varuṇa and mitra.
o aditi may all the deities love us and thou o aryaman while we are singing.
looking on man o varuṇa and mitra this sun ascendeth up by both the pathways.
guardian of all things fixt of all that moveth beholding good and evil acts of mortals.
he from their home hath yoked the seven gold coursers who dropping oil and fatness carry sūrya.
yours varuṇa and mitra he surveyeth the worlds and living creatures like a herdsman.
your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted to the bright ocean sūrya hath ascended.
for whom the Ādityas make his pathway ready aryaman mitra varuṇa accordant.
for these even aryaman varuṇa and mitra are the chastisers of all guile and falsehood.
these aditis sons infallible and mighty have waxen in the home of law eternal.
these mitra varuṇa whom none deceiveth with great power quicken even the fool to wisdom.
and wakening moreover thoughtful insight lead it by easy paths oer grief and trouble.
they ever vigilant with eyes that close not caring for heaven and earth lead on the thoughtless.
even in the rivers bed there is a shallow across this broad expanse may they conduct us.
when aditi and varuṇa and mitra like guardians give sudās their friendly shelter.
granting him sons and lineal succession let us not bold ones move the gods to anger.
may he with ofierings purify the altar from any stains of varuṇas reviler.
aryaman save us us all those who hate us give room and freedom to sudās ye mighty.
hid from our eyes is their resplendent meeting by their mysterious might they hold dominion.
heroes we cry trembling in fear before you even in the greatness of your power have mercy.
he who wins favour for his prayer by worship that he may gain him strength and highest riches.
that good mans mind the mighty ones will follow they have brought comfort to his spacious dwelling.
this priestly task gods varuṇa and mitra hath been performed for you at sacrifices.
convey us safely over every peril preserve us evermore ye gods with blessings.
