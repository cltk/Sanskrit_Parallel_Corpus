i sing a lofty song for she is mightiest most divine of streams.
sarasvatī will i exalt with hymns and lauds and o vasiṣṭha heaven and earth.
when in the fulness of their strength the pūrus dwell beauteous one on thy two grassy banks.
favour us thou who hast the maruts for thy friends stir up the bounty of our chiefs.
so may sarasvatī auspicious send good luck she rich in spoil is never niggardly in thought.
when praised in jamadagnis way and lauded as vasiṣṭha lauds.
we call upon sarasvān as unmarried men who long for wives.
as liberal men who yearn for sons.
be thou our kind protector o sarasvān with those waves of thine.
laden with sweets and dropping oil.
may we enjoy sarasvāns breast allbeautiful that swells with streams.
may we gain food and progeny.
