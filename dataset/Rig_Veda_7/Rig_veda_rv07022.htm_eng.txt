drink soma lord of bays and let it cheer thee indra the stone like a well guided courser.
directed by the pressers arms hath pressed it.
so let the draught of joy thy dear companion by which o lord of bays thou slayest foemen.
delight thee indra lord of princely treasures.
mark closely maghavan the words i utter this eulogy recited by vasiṣṭha.
accept the prayers i offer at thy banquet.
hear thou the call of the juicedrinking pressstone hear thou the brahmans hymn who sings and lauds thee.
take to thine inmost self these adorations.
i know and neer forget the hymns and praises of thee the conqueror and thy strength immortal.
thy name i ever utter selfrefulgent.
among mankind many are thy libations and many a time the pious sageinvokes thee.
o maghavan be not long distant from us.
all these libations are for thee o hero to thee i offer these my prayers that strengthen.
ever in every place must men invoke thee.
never do men attain o wonderworker thy greatness mighty one who must be lauded.
nor indra thine heroic power and bounty.
among all Ṛṣis indra old and recent who have engendered hymns as sacred singers.
even with us be thine auspicious friendships ye gods preserve us evermore with blessings.
