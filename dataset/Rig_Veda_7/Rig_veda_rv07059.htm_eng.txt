whomso ye rescue here and there whomso ye guide o deities.
to him give shelter agni mitra varuṇa ye maruts and thou aryaman.
through your kind favour gods on some auspicious day the worshipper subdues his foes.
that man increases home and strengthening ample food who brings you offerings as ye list.
vasiṣṭha will not overlook the lowliest one among you all.
o maruts of our soma juice effused today drink all of you with eager haste.
your succour in the battle injures not the man to whom ye heroes grant your gifts.
may your most recent favour turn to us again come quickly ye who fain would drink.
come hitherward to drink the juice o ye whose bounties give you joy.
these offerings are for you these maruts i present go not to any place but this.
sit on our sacred grass be graciously inclined to give the wealth for which we long.
to take delight ye maruts friends of all with svāhā in sweet soma juice.
decking the beauty of their forms in secret the swans with purple backs have flown down hither.
around me all the company hath settled like joyous heroes glad in our libation.
maruts the man whose wrath is hard to master he who would slay us ere we think o vasus.
may he be tangled in the toils of mischief smite ye him down with your most flaming weapon.
o maruts ye consuming gods enjoy this offering brought for you.
to help us ye who slay the foe.
sharers of household sacrifice come maruts stay not far away.
that ye may help us bounteous ones.
here selfstrong maruts yea even here ye sages with your sunbright skins.
i dedicate your sacrifice.
tryambaka we worship sweet augmenter of prosperity.
as from its stem the cucumber so may i be released from death not reft of immortality.
