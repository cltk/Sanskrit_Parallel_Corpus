i will declare the manly deeds of indra the first that he achieved the thunderwielder.
he slew the dragon then disclosed the waters and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.
he slew the dragon lying on the mountain his heavenly bolt of thunder tvaṣṭar fashioned.
like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.
impetuous as a bull he chose the soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices.
maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.
when indra thou hadst slain the dragons firstborn and overcome the charms of the enchanters.
then giving life to sun and dawn and heaven thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.
indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces vṛtra worst of vṛtras.
as trunks of trees what time the axe hath felled them low on the earth so lies the prostrate dragon.
he like a mad weak warrior challenged indra the great impetuous manyslaying hero.
he brooking not the clashing of the weapons crushedindras foethe shattered forts in falling.
footless and handless still he challenged indra who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders.
emasculate yet claiming manly vigour thus vṛtra lay with scattered limbs dissevered.
there as he lies like a bankbursting river the waters taking courage flow above him.
the dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which vṛtra with his greatness had encompassed.
then humbled was the strength of vṛtras mother indra hath cast his deadly bolt against her.
the mother was above the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay danu.
rolled in the midst of neverceasing currents flowing without a rest for ever onward.
the waters bear off vṛtras nameless body the foe of indra sank to during darkness.
guarded by ahi stood the thralls of dāsas the waters stayed like kine held by the robber.
but he when he had smitten vṛtra opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.
a horses tail wast thou when he o indra smote on thy bolt thou god without a second.
thou hast won back the kine hast won the soma thou hast let loose to flow the seven rivers.
nothing availed him lightning nothing thunder hailstorm or mist which had spread around him.
when indra and the dragon strove in battle maghavan gained the victory for ever.
whom sawest thou to avenge the dragon indra that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him.
that like a hawk affrighted through the regions thou crossedst nineandninety flowing rivers.
indra is king of all that moves and moves not of creatures tame and horned the thunderwielder.
over all living men he rules as sovran containing all as spokes within the felly.
